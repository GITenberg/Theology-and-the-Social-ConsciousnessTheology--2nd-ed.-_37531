<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no attempt in this book to
present a complete system of theology, though much of such a system is
passed in review, but only to study a special phase of theological
thinking. The precise theme of the book is the relations of the social
consciousness to theology. This is the subject upon which the writer
was asked to lecture at the Harvard Summer School of Theology of 1901;
and the book has grown out of the lectures there given. In preparing
the book for the press, however, the lecture form has been entirely
abandoned, and considerable material added.</p>

<p>The importance of the theme seems to justify a somewhat
thorough-going treatment. If one believes at all in the presence of
God in history&mdash;and the Christian can have no doubt here&mdash;he must be
profoundly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii"
id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> interested in such a phenomenon as
the steady growth of the social consciousness. Hardly any inner
characteristic of our time has a stronger historical justification
than that consciousness; and it has carried the reason and conscience
of the men of this generation in rare degree. Having its own
comparatively independent development, and yet making an ethical
demand that is thoroughly Christian, it furnishes an almost ideal
standpoint from which to review our theological statements, and, at
the same time, a valuable test of their really Christian quality.</p>

<p>In attempting, then, a careful study of the relations of the social
consciousness to theology, this book aims, first, definitely to get at
the real meaning of the social consciousness as the theologian must
view it, and so to bring clearly into mind the unconscious assumptions
of the social consciousness itself; and then to trace out the
influence of the social consciousness upon the conception of religion,
and upon theological <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix"
id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> doctrine. The larger portion of the book
is naturally given to the influence upon theological doctrine; and to
make the discussion here as pointed as possible, the different
elements of the social consciousness are considered separately.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the question raised is not the
historical one, How, as a matter of fact, has the social consciousness
modified the conception of religion or the statement of theological
doctrine? but the theoretical one, How should the social consciousness
naturally affect religion and doctrine? In this sense, the result
might be called, in President Hyde's phrase, a "social theology"; but,
as I believe that the social consciousness is at bottom only a true
sense of the fully personal, I prefer myself to think of the present
book as only carrying out in more detail the contention of my
<i>Reconstruction in Theology</i>&mdash;that theology should aim at a
restatement of doctrine in strictly personal terms. So conceived, in
spite of its casual origin, this book follows very naturally upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> the
previous book. Some of the same topics necessarily recur here; and
references to the <i>Reconstruction</i> have been freely made, in
order to avoid all unnecessary repetition.</p>

<p>That this social sense of the fully personal has finally a real and
definite contribution to make to theology, I cannot doubt. I can only
hope that the present discussion may be found at least suggestive,
particularly in the analysis of the social consciousness, and in the
treatment of mysticism and of the ethical in religion, as well as in
the consideration of the special influence of the elements of the
social consciousness upon the restatement of doctrine. Of the
doctrinal applications, the application to the problem of redemption
may be considered, perhaps, of most significance.</p>

<h1>THEOLOGY AND THE SOCIAL<br />CONSCIOUSNESS</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>INTRODUCTION<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE
THEME</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> theologian can be excused to-day from
a careful study of the relations of theology and the social
consciousness. Whether this study becomes a formal investigation or
not, the social consciousness is so deep and significant a phenomenon
in the ethical life of our time, that it cannot be ignored by the
theologian who means to bring his message to men really home. This
book is written in the conviction that, while men are thus moved as
never before by a deep sense of mutual influence and obligation, they
have also as deep and genuine an interest as ever in the really
greatest questions of religion and theology. Interests so significant
and so akin cannot long remain isolated in the mind. They are certain
soon profoundly to influence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2"
id="page_2">{2}</a></span> each other. And this mutual influence of
theology and the social consciousness form the theme of this book.</p>

<p>Two questions are naturally involved in this theme. First: Has
theology given any help, or has it any help to give, to the social
consciousness?&mdash;the question of the first division of the book.
Second: Has the social consciousness made any contribution, or has it
any contribution to make, to theology?&mdash;the question of the second and
third divisions. That is to say: On the one hand, Have the great facts
which theology studies any help to give to the man who faces the
problem of social progress&mdash;of the steady elevation of the race? On
the other hand, Has the great fact of the immensely quickened social
consciousness of our time, with all that it means, any help to give to
the theologian in his attempt to bring the great Christian truths
really home to men, to make them more real, more rational, more
vital?</p>

<p>Or again: On the one hand, do theological doctrines&mdash;the most
adequate statements we can make of the great Christian truths&mdash;best
explain and best ground the social consciousness, so as best to bring
our entire thought in this sphere of the social into unity? Is <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> the
Christian truth so great that it not only includes all that is true in
this new social consciousness&mdash;is fully able to take it up into itself
and to make it feel at home there&mdash;but also, so great that it alone
can give the social consciousness its fullest meaning, alone enable it
to understand itself, and alone furnish it adequate motive and power?
Is the social consciousness, in truth, only a disguised statement of
Christian convictions, and does it really require the Christian
religion and its thoughtful expression to complete itself? Must the
social consciousness say, when it comes to full self-knowledge,&mdash;I am
myself an unmeaning and unjustified by-product, if there is not a God
in the full Christian sense? and, so saying, confirm again the great
Christian truths? This is the question of the first division.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since the task of any given theologian is
necessarily temporary, and since any marked modification of the
consciousness of men will inevitably demand some restatement of
theological doctrine, the question here becomes&mdash;To what changed
points of view in religion and theology, to what restatements of
doctrine, and so to what truer appreciation of Christian truth, does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> the
new social consciousness naturally lead? How do the affirmations of
the social consciousness, as the outcome of a careful, inductive study
of the social evolution of the race, affect our theological
statements? This is the question of the second and third divisions of
the book.</p>

<p>Our discussion must of course assume and build on the conclusions
of sociology, and of New Testament theology, especially the
conclusions concerning the social teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span></p>


<h2>THE REAL MEANING OF THE SOCIAL<br /> CONSCIOUSNESS FOR THEOLOGY</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE POINT OF
VIEW OF THE THEOLOGIAN</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, then, what is the real meaning of
the social consciousness, as the theologian must view it? The answer
to this question involves a preliminary one: What is the point of view
of the theologian in any investigation? One can only give his own
answer.</p>

<p>First of all, the theologian, as such, is an <i>interpreter</i>,
not a tracer of causal connections. He builds everywhere upon the
scientific investigator, and takes from him the statement of facts and
processes. With these he has primarily nothing to do. With reference
to the social consciousness, therefore, he does not attempt to do over
again the work of the sociologist; he asks only, What does the social
consciousness, in the light of the whole <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> of life and thought, mean;
not, How did it come about?</p>

<p>The theologian, too, is a <i>believer in the supremacy of spiritual
interests</i>; this is his central contention. He affirms strenuously,
with the scientific worker, the place and value of the mechanical; but
he is certain that the mechanical can understand itself even, only as
it is seen to be simple means, and thus clearly subordinate in
significance. His problem is, therefore, everywhere, that of ideal
interpretation, not of mechanical explanation. But, while he has
nothing to do with the scientific tracing of immediate causal
connections, he recognizes causality itself as requiring an ultimate
explanation, that cannot be mechanically given. The theologian must be
in this, then, an <i>ideal</i> interpreter, and an inquirer after the
<i>ultimate</i> cause.</p>

<p>The theologian assumes, moreover, the legitimacy and value of the
fact of <i>religion</i>; for theology is simply the thoughtful,
comprehensive, and unified expression of what religion means to us.
The meaning of the social consciousness to the theologian involves,
therefore, at once the question of its relation to religious
conviction.</p>

<p>The point of view of the Christian theologian <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> involves,
besides, the <i>reality of the personal God</i> in personal relation
to persons. Theology is in earnest in its thought of God, and knows
that God is everywhere to be taken into account; that, if there is a
God at all, he is not to be exiled into some corner of his universe,
but is intimately concerned in all, is at the very heart of all; and
that, therefore, it is not a matter of merely curious interest or of
subsidiary inquiry, whether we are to look at our questions with God
in mind.</p>

<p>Finally, the Christian theologian tries everywhere to make his
point of view <i>the point of view of Christ</i>. The theology, upon
which he ultimately stakes his all, is Christ's theology. He knows
that there is much concerning which he cannot refuse to think, but
upon which Christ has not expressed himself either explicitly or by
clear inference; but in all this unavoidable supplementary thinking he
aims to be absolutely loyal to the spirit of Christ.</p>

<p>From this point of view of the Christian theologian, now, what does
the social consciousness mean? The answer may be given under four
heads: (1) the definition of the social consciousness; (2) the
inadequacy of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8"
id="page_8">{8}</a></span> the analogy of the organism, as an
expression of the social consciousness; (3) the necessity of the
facts, of which the social consciousness is the reflection, if ideal
interests are to be supreme; (4) the ultimate explanation and ground
of the social consciousness.</p>

<p>These four topics form the subjects of the four chapters of the
first division of our inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE DEFINITION
OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> simplest and probably the most
accurate single expression we can give to the social consciousness, is
to say that it is a growing sense of the real brotherhood of men. But
five elements seem plainly involved in this, and may be profitably
separated in our thought, if that is to be clear and definite:&mdash;a
deepening sense (1) of the likeness or like-mindedness of men, (2) of
their mutual influence, (3) of the value and sacredness of the person,
(4) of mutual obligation, and (5) of love.</p>

<h4>I. THE SENSE OF THE LIKE-MINDEDNESS OF MEN<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_1" id="R_1"
href="#F_1">[1]</a></span></h4>

<p>If a society is "a group of like-minded individuals," if the
"all-essential" requisites for coöperation are "like-mindedness and
consciousness of kind," as Giddings tells us, then certainly a prime
element in the social consciousness is likeness and the sense of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> it&mdash;a
growing sense of the mental and moral resemblance and "potential
resemblance" of all men, and of all classes of men, though not
equality of powers.</p>

<p>"Equality of need" among men, too,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_2" id="R_2" href="#F_2">[2]</a></span> to which sociology
comes as one of its surest conclusions, implies a common capacity,
even if in varying degrees, to enter into the most fundamental
interests of life, and so points unmistakably to the essential
likeness of men in the most important things.</p>

<p>So, too, sociology's unquestioning assertion that both smaller and
larger groups of men constantly tend toward unity, assumes potential
resemblance.</p>

<p>And the uniform experience and prescription of social workers, that
<i>really</i> knowing "how the other half lives" brings increasing
sympathy, also affirm the fundamental likeness of men. Every
painstaking investigation of a social question comes out at some point
or other with a fresh discovery of a previously hidden, underlying
resemblance between classes of men.</p>

<p>From the careful, inductive study of social evolution, too, the men
of our day see, as no other generation has seen, that the great force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span>
always and everywhere at work in that evolution has been likeness and
the consciousness of it.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, this generation believes, as men never
believed before, in the essential like-mindedness of men; and this
deepening sense of the like-mindedness of men is certainly one element
in the modern social consciousness.</p>

<h4>II. THE SENSE OF THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF MEN</h4>

<p>A second element in the social consciousness, and, perhaps, that
which has most of all characterized it through the larger period of
its growth, is the strong sense of the mutual influence of men&mdash;that
we are all "members one of another."</p>

<p>1. <i>Contributing Lines of Thought.</i>&mdash;It is worth seeing how
firmly planted the idea is. Several lines of thought have united to
induce men to emphasize&mdash;perhaps even to over-emphasize&mdash;this way of
thinking of society. The influence of natural science, in the first
place, has been inevitably in this direction. Its root idea of the
universality of law forces upon one the thought of a world which is a
<i>coherent</i> whole, a unity with <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> universal forces in it, in
which every part is inextricably connected with every other. So, too,
the acceptance of the theory of evolution has led science to regard
the whole history of the physical universe as an organic growth.</p>

<p>Psychology, also, with its present-day emphasis, in Baldwin and
Royce, upon the constant presence and fundamental character of
<i>imitation</i>, and its insistence upon the still more fundamental
impulsiveness of consciousness which Dewey believes underlies
imitation,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_3" id="R_3"
href="#F_3">[3]</a></span> is really proclaiming exactly this element
of the social consciousness. And the whole assertion by the later
psychology of the unity of man&mdash;mind and body, and of the complex
intertwining of all the functions of the mind, is in closest harmony
with a similar view of society.</p>

<p>Philosophy, too, is exerting all along a half-unconscious pressure
toward the thought of the organic unity of society. That philosophy
may exist at all, it must start from the assumption of a universe, a
real unity of truth, and its problem is to find a <i>discerned</i>
unity. It knows no unrelated being, and, consequently, whether it
theoretically accepts <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13"
id="page_13">{13}</a></span> the formulation or not, it must admit
that, as a matter of fact, to be is to be in relations. It asserts as
a universal fact, what natural science and psychology both affirm in
their own respective spheres, the concrete relatedness of all. It
cannot well deny the same thought when applied to society. Its
repeated attempts, moreover, to conceive all as a developing unity,
and the profound influence of the analogy of the organism upon its
history, both further sustain the organic view of society.</p>

<p>Christianity, as well, has been a powerful factor in this direction
from the beginning, for it really first gave the Idea of
Humanity.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_4" id="R_4"
href="#F_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>The Threefold Form of the Conviction.</i>&mdash;Sustained, now, by
all these movements in natural science, psychology, philosophy, and
Christianity, this thought of the mutual influence of men has taken
three forms: that mutual influence is inevitable, isolation
impossible; that mutual influence is desirable, isolation to be
shunned; that mutual influence is indispensable, isolation
blighting.</p>

<p>(1) This second element in the social consciousness has meant,
then, in the first place, a growing sense of the inevitableness <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> of the
mutual influence of all men, and of all classes of men; that we are
all parts of one whole, each part unavoidably affected by every other;
that we are bound up in one bundle of life with all men, and cannot
live an isolated life if we would; that we do influence one another
whether we will or not, and tend unconsciously to draw others to our
level and are ourselves drawn toward theirs; that we joy and suffer
together whether we will or not, and grow or deteriorate together.</p>

<p>(2) But the mutual influence of men means more than this: not only
that we do inevitably affect one another in living out our own life,
but a growing sense of the fact that we are obviously not intended to
come to our best in independence of one another; that we are made on
so large a plan that we cannot come to our best alone; that we are
evidently made for personal relations, and that, therefore, largeness
of life for ourselves depends on our entering into the life of
others.</p>

<p>(3) But even more than this is true. It is not only that entering
into the life of others is a help in my life, it is <i>the</i> great
help, the one great means, the indispensable, the essential <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>
condition of all largeness of life; it is the very meaning of
life,&mdash;life itself. We are to find our life only in losing our life.
Life is the fulfilment of relations. When we try to run away from the
variety and complexity of these relations, we are running away from
life itself. The indispensableness of these relations to others is
assumed, also, in the assertion by the sociologist of an evolution
toward a society, at once more and more complex, and more and more
perfect.</p>

<p>But if I grow in the growth of another, the other grows in my
growth. If the only thing of value that I can finally give is myself,
the value of that gift depends upon the largeness and richness of the
self given. For love's own sake, therefore, I must grow, must strive
to bring to its highest perfection that work which is given me to do.
A person is a social being called to contribute to the whole, in the
line of his own best possibilities. One's largest ministry to others
is to be rendered, then, through sacred regard for one's own calling,
considered as exactly his place of largest service. Or, to put it the
other way: I can come to my best only in work so great and in
associations so large <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16"
id="page_16">{16}</a></span> that I may lose myself in them in perfect
objectivity.</p>

<p>The mutual influence of men, therefore, is unavoidable, is
desirable, is indispensable; isolation impossible, hindering,
blighting. This is the true solidarity of the race, in which there is
no fiction, no hiding in the inconceivable, and no pretense.</p>

<h4>III. THE SENSE OF THE VALUE AND SACREDNESS OF THE PERSON</h4>

<p>The third element in the social consciousness, the sense of the
value and sacredness of the person, follows naturally from the sense
of like-mindedness and of mutual influence, but needs distinct and
emphatic statement.</p>

<p>It is less easily separable than the other elements named, and,
indeed, may be made to include all the others, and does, in a way,
carry all with it. Thus broadly conceived, it has seemed to the writer
that&mdash;with the return to the historical Christ&mdash;it might well be
called the most notable moral characteristic of our time.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_5" id="R_5" href="#F_5">[5]</a></span>
But, though less easily and definitely discriminated, one who knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
deeply the modern social consciousness would surely feel that the very
heart of it had been omitted, if this growing sense of the value and
sacredness of the person did not come to strong expression. Reverence
for personality&mdash;the steadily deepening sense that every person has a
value not to be measured in anything else, and is in himself sacred to
God and man&mdash;this it is which marks unmistakably every step in the
progress of the individual and of the race. Without it, whatever the
other marks of civilization, you have only tyranny and slavery; with
it, though every trace of luxury and scientific invention be lacking,
you have the perfection of human relations.</p>

<p>This sense of the value and sacredness of the person not only
characterizes increasingly the whole social and moral evolution of the
race, but it is to be seen in the clearly conscious demand for
equality of rights, and, especially&mdash;to take a single example&mdash;in the
growing recognition that the child is an individual with his own
rights; that he has a personality of his own of a sanctity inviolable
by the parent; that there are clear bounds beyond which no one may go
without personal outrage. The recognition by <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> psychology of respect for
personality as one of the three or four most fundamental
conditions&mdash;if not the most essential of all&mdash;of happiness, of
character, and of influence, is explicit confirmation of the truth of
this element of the social consciousness.</p>

<h4>IV. THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION</h4>

<p>But the elements of the social consciousness already named lead
directly to a growing sense of obligation. Every man carries in
himself his only possible standard of measurement of all else. A
growing sense of the likeness of other men to himself quickens at
once, therefore, the sense of obligation, and leads naturally to the
Golden Rule. Recognition of mutual influence, too, inevitably carries
with it a deeper sense of obligation; for, if we do affect others
constantly, then we are manifestly under obligation not only to do
direct service to others, but so to order our own lives as to help,
not to hinder, others. The sense of the value and sacredness of the
person plainly looks to the same deepening of obligation.</p>

<p>As an element of the social consciousness, the sense of obligation
means for a given <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19"
id="page_19">{19}</a></span> individual, a growing sense of
responsibility for all; and for society at large an increase in the
number of those who feel the obligation to serve.</p>

<p>The growth in each of these directions cannot be questioned. There
is no privileged class, in whose own consciences there is not being
recognized more and more the right of the claim that they must justify
themselves by service which shall be as unique as their privilege. In
consequence, the conception of the governing classes is steadily
changing, for both the governed and the governing, to some recognition
of Christ's principle, that he who would be first must be servant of
all. The sharp insistence of the sociologist that "organization must
be for the organized" expresses the same thought. One must add
sociology's double assertion, that society is really advancing toward
its goal, and yet that a chief condition of the progress of society is
unselfish leadership.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_6" id="R_6"
href="#F_6">[6]</a></span> This can only mean that there is,
increasingly, unselfish leadership, more and more of conscious,
willing coöperation on the part of men in forwarding the social
evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20"
id="page_20">{20}</a></span> None of us can return to the older
attitude of comparative indifference, nor can we honestly defend it.
We do have obligations and we own them; we are judging ourselves
increasingly by Christ's test of ministering love.</p>

<h4>V. THE SENSE OF LOVE</h4>

<p>And the social consciousness ends necessarily in love, in the
broader, ethical meaning of that word. We shall never feel that the
social consciousness is complete, short of real love. All the other
elements of the social consciousness lead to love and are included in
it. Even the sociologist must bring in as necessary results of the
consciousness of kind&mdash;sympathy, affection, and desire for the
recognition of others;<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_7" id="R_7"
href="#F_7">[7]</a></span> and he finds these always more or less
distinctly at work among men.</p>

<p>These further considerations from the study of evolution confirm
this result: that man is preëminently the social animal;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_8" id="R_8" href="#F_8">[8]</a></span>
that with man we have clearly reached the stage of persons and of
personal relations;<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_9" id="R_9"
href="#F_9">[9]</a></span> that the very existence and development of
man required <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21"
id="page_21">{21}</a></span> love at every step;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_10" id="R_10" href="#F_10">[10]</a></span>
and that the chief moral significance of man's prolonged infancy is
probably to be found in the necessary calling out of love.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_11" id="R_11"
href="#F_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>So, too, it has become constantly more and more clear that our
obligation, what we owe to others, is ourselves; and the giving of the
self is love. It seems to be thrust home upon social workers
everywhere that there is no solution of any social problem without a
personal self-giving in some way on the part of some; that there is no
cheaper way than this very costly one of love, of the giving of
ourselves&mdash;whether in the family, or in charity, or in
criminology.</p>

<p>The point, already noted, that the progress of society depends on
leaders who will serve with unselfish devotion, is only another
emphasis upon love as an indispensable element of the social
consciousness.</p>

<p>And the social goal&mdash;equality, brotherhood, liberty, when these
terms are given any adequate ethical content&mdash;is absolutely
unthinkable in any really vital sense without love.</p>

<p>Any attempted definition of love, moreover, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>
resolves at once into what we mean by the social consciousness. If we
define love as the giving of self, this is exactly what, with growing
clearness and insistence, the social consciousness demands. If with
Herrmann we call love, "joy in personal life"&mdash;joy, that is, in the
revelation of personal life, this can only come in that trustful,
reverent, self-surrendering association to which the social
consciousness exhorts. If with Edwards we call love, willing the
highest and completest good of all, we reach the same result. Or if
with Christ in the Beatitudes, or with Paul in the thirteenth of I
Corinthians, we study the characteristics of love, we shall hardly
doubt that a complete social consciousness must have these marks of
love.</p>

<p>These elements, then, make up the social consciousness: the sense
of like-mindedness, of mutual influence, of the value and sacredness
of the person, of obligation, and of love; and all these, with their
implied demands, only point to what a person must be if he is to be
fully personal.</p>

<p>With this definition in mind, we may now ask, whether the analogy
of the organism can adequately express the social consciousness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE INADEQUACY
OF THE ANALOGY OF THE ORGANISM<br /> AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIAL
CONSCIOUSNESS</i></span><span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_12"
id="R_12" href="#F_12">[12]</a></span></h3>

<h4>I. THE VALUE OF THE ANALOGY</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> analogy of the organism has played
so large a part in the history of thought, especially in the
consideration of ethical and social questions, that it is well worth
while to ask exactly how far this analogy is adequate, although the
danger of the abuse of the analogy is probably somewhat less than
formerly.</p>

<p>It may be said at once that it is, undoubtedly, the very best
illustration of these social relations that we can draw from nature,
and it is of real value. It has had, moreover, as already indicated, a
most influential and largely honorable history in the development of
the thought of men. Its classical expression is in the epoch-making
twelfth chapter of I Corinthians, which makes so plain the ethical
applications of the analogy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<h4>II. THE INEVITABLE INADEQUACY OF THE ANALOGY</h4>

<p>1. <i>Comes from the Sub-personal World.</i>&mdash;But it ought clearly
to be seen, on the other hand, that, considered as a complete
expression of the social consciousness, it is necessarily inadequate;
and it is of moment that we should not be dominated by it. Too often
it has been made to cover the entire ground, as though in itself it
were a complete expression and final explanation of the social
consciousness, instead of a quite incomplete illustration. For, in the
first place, the very fact that the analogy comes from the physical
world, from the sub-personal realm, makes it certain that it must fail
at vital points in the expression of what is peculiarly a personal and
ethical fact. We cannot safely argue directly from the physical
illustration to ethical propositions.</p>

<p>2. <i>Access to Reality, Only Through Ourselves.</i>&mdash;Moreover, in
this day of extraordinary attention to the physical world, it is
particularly important that we should keep constantly in mind that we
have direct access to reality only in ourselves; that man is himself
necessarily the only key which we can use for any <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>
ultimate understanding of anything; or, as Paulsen puts it, "I know
reality as it is in itself, in so far as I am real myself, or in so
far as it is, or is like, that which I am, namely, spirit."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_13" id="R_13" href="#F_13">[13]</a></span>
We are not to forget that, in very truth, we know <i>better</i> what
we mean by persons and personal relations, than we do what we mean by
members of a body and by organic relations; and, further, that in
point of fact, all those metaphysical notions by which we strive to
think things are ultimately derived from ourselves; and that then we
illogically turn back upon our own minds, from which all these notions
came, to explain the mind in the same secondary way in which we
explain other things.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mistaken Passion for Construing Everything.</i>&mdash;Natural
science, with its sole problem of the tracing of immediate causal
connections, naturally provokes a persistent, but nevertheless
thoroughly mistaken, "passion," as Lotze calls it,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_14" id="R_14" href="#F_14">[14]</a></span>
"for construing everything,"&mdash;even the most real and final reality,
spirit; which wishes to see even this real and final reality explained
as the mechanical result of the combination of simpler elements,
themselves, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26"
id="page_26">{26}</a></span> it is to be noted, finally absolutely
inexplicable. Such perverse attempts will be widely hailed, by many
who do not understand themselves, as highly scientific. And one who
refuses to enter upon such investigations will be criticized by such
minds as "hardly getting into grips with his subject."</p>

<p>But it is a false application of the scientific instinct that leads
one to seek mechanical explanation for the final reality, or that
urges to precision of formulation beyond that warranted by the data.
It is from exactly this falsely scientific bias that theology needs
deliverance. "For," as Aristotle reminds us, "it is the mark of a man
of culture to try to attain exactness in each kind of knowledge just
so far as the nature of the subject allows." There is a wise
agnosticism that is violated alike by negative and by positive
dogmatism. It is often overlooked that there is an over-wise
radicalism that assumes a knowledge of the depth of the finite and
infinite, quite as insistent and dogmatic as the view it supposes
itself to be opposing. "I know it is not so," it ought not to need to
be said, is not agnosticism.</p>

<p>The guiding principle in a truly scientific theology is this, as
Lotze suggests: Just <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27"
id="page_27">{27}</a></span> so far as changing action depends upon
altering conditions, we have explanatory and constructive problems to
solve, and no farther. No philosophical view can do without a simply
given reality. And we shall never succeed in understanding by what
machinery reality is manufactured&mdash;in "deducing the whole positive
content of reality from mere modifications of formal conditions."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_15" id="R_15"
href="#F_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall not allow ourselves to be misled, therefore, by the
scientific sound of the <i>detailed</i> application of the analogy of
the organism to the facts of the social consciousness. And it is a
satisfaction to see that the clearest sociological writers are coming
to agree that there is strictly no "social mind" that can be affirmed
to exist as a separate reality, supposed to answer to society
conceived in its totality as an organism.</p>

<h4>III. THE ANALOGY TESTED BY THE DEFINITION<br />
OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS</h4>

<p>When, now, we test the analogy of the organism by its competency to
express the full meaning of the social consciousness, as it has been
defined, we must say that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28"
id="page_28">{28}</a></span> analogy but feebly expresses the likeness
of men; it best expresses the inevitableness of mutual influence,
though even here there is no understandable ultimate explanation; it
fairly expresses the desirableness and indispensableness of mutual
influence, but, of course, with entire lack of ethical meaning; and it
quite fails to express the sense of the value and the sacredness of
the person, the sense of obligation, and the sense of love. We need to
see and feel exactly these shortcomings, if we are not to abuse the
analogy. There is no social consciousness that will hold water that
does not rest on what Phillips Brooks called "a healthy and
ineradicable individualism," in the sense of the recognition of the
fully personal. We are spirits, not organisms, and society is a
society of persons, not an organism, in a strict sense. Why should we
wish to make society less significant than it is?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE NECESSITY
OF THE FACTS, OF WHICH THE SOCIAL<br /> CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE
REFLECTION, IF IDEAL<br />INTERESTS ARE TO BE SUPREME</i></span></h3>

<h4>I. THE QUESTION</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> this positive and negative
definition of the social consciousness in our minds, a third question
immediately suggests itself to one who wishes to go to the bottom of
our theme. Why must the facts, of which the social consciousness is
the reflection, be as they are if ideal interests are to be supreme?
What has a theodicy to say as to these facts? Why, that is, from the
point of view of the ideal&mdash;of religion and theology&mdash;why are we
constituted so alike? so that we must influence one another? so that
the results of our actions necessarily go over into the lives of
others? so that the innocent suffer with the guilty and the guilty
profit with the righteous? so that we must recognize everywhere the
claim of others? so that we must respect their personality? and so
that we must love them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30"
id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<h4>II. OTHERWISE NO MORAL WORLD AT ALL</h4>

<p>The answer to all these world-old questions may perhaps be
contained in the single statement, that otherwise we should have no
moral world at all. There would be no thinkable moral universe, but
rather as many worlds as there are individuals, having no more to do
with one another than the chemical reactions going on in a set of
test-tubes.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Prerequisites of a Moral World.</i> For our human
thinking, assuredly, there are certain prerequisites, that the world
may be at all a sphere for moral training and action. What are these
prerequisites for a moral world? There must be, in the first place, a
<i>sphere of universal law</i>, to count on, within which all actions
take place. In a lawless world, action could hardly take on any
significance&mdash;least of all ethical significance. That freedom itself
should mean anything in outward expression, there must be the
possibility of intelligent use of means toward the ends chosen.</p>

<p>There must be, in the second place, some <i>real ethical
freedom</i>, some power of moral initiative. We need not quarrel about
the terms used; but, as Paulsen intimates, no serious <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> ethical
writer ever doubted that men have at least some power to shape their
own characters.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_16" id="R_16"
href="#F_16">[16]</a></span> Without that assumption, we have a whole
world of ideas and ideals&mdash;many of them the realest facts in the world
to us&mdash;that have no legitimate excuse for being, that are simple
insanities of the most inexplicable sort. The very meaning of the
personality, indeed, which the social consciousness must demand for
men, is some real existence for self, that is, some real
self-consciousness and moral initiative.</p>

<p>And freedom is not enough; there must be also <i>some power of
accomplishment</i>. To ascribe mere volition to man seems, it has been
justly said, sophistical. Results are needed to reveal the character
of our acts, even to ourselves&mdash;to make that character real. Lotze's
charge that the world is imperfect because it might have been so made
that only good designs could be carried out, or so that the results of
evil volitions would be at once corrected,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_17" id="R_17" href="#F_17">[17]</a></span> is itself similarly
sophistical. Such a world, in which the outward results of action
never appear, would be but a play-world after all&mdash;only a nursery of
babes not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32"
id="page_32">{32}</a></span> yet capable of character. It could be no
fit world for moral training.</p>

<p>And still more, not less, must this law of the necessary results of
actions hold in our relations to other persons. There can be, least of
all, a moral universe where we are not <i>members one of another</i>.
Character, in any form we can conceive it, could not then exist. Our
best, as well as our worst, possibilities are involved in these
necessary mutual relations. Moral character has meaning only in
personal relations. The results, therefore, which follow upon action,
if the character of our deed is to have reality for us, must be
chiefly personal. The realm of character has fearful possibilities.
This <i>is</i> no play-world. We can cause and be caused suffering,
and our sin necessarily carries the suffering, if not the sin, of
others with it.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Ideal World Requires, thus, the Facts of the Social
Consciousness.</i>&mdash;All this could be changed in any vital way only by
shutting up every soul absolutely to itself, and with that result life
has simply ceased.</p>

<p>For we cannot really conceive a person as having any reason for
being without such relations. He would be constantly baffled at every
point, for he is made for persons and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> personal relations. Love,
too, the highest source of both character and happiness, requires
everywhere personal relations. Religion itself, as a sharing of the
life of God, would be impossible without some relation to others; for
God, at least, could not be separated from the life of all. That is,
persons, love, religion, in such a world, have gone.</p>

<p>This, then, simply means that the ideal world ceases to be, with
the denial of the facts that the social consciousness reflects. We
must be full persons, social beings in the entire meaning demanded by
the social consciousness&mdash;hard as the consequences involved often
are&mdash;if ideal interests are to be supreme. Indeed, the very moral
judgment, that incessantly prompts the problem of evil for every one
of us, is required, for its own existence, to assume the validity of
the relations about which it questions. For it complains, for the most
part, of those facts that follow inevitably from the necessary mutual
influence of men; but the chief sources of the joy it requires, that
it may justify the world, lie in these same mutual relations. It
assumes, thus, in its claims on the world, the validity and worth of
the very relations of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34"
id="page_34">{34}</a></span> which it complains in its criticism of
the world. Or, slightly to vary the statement, the major premise, even
of pessimism, is that a really justifiable world must have worth in
the joy it yields in personal life, impossible out of the personal
relations of a real moral universe. And there can be no moral universe
without the facts reflected in the social consciousness. The ideal
world requires, then, the facts of the social consciousness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br /><br /><span class="h90"><i>THE ULTIMATE
EXPLANATION AND GROUND OF THE<br />SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most important and fundamental
inquiry as to the possible help of theology to the social
consciousness still remains: What is the ultimate explanation and
ground of the social consciousness? This question includes two: (1)
How can it be metaphysically that we do influence one another? (2)
What is required for the final positive justification of the social
consciousness as ethical? Theology's answer to both questions is found
in the being and character of God, the creative and moral source of
all.</p>

<h4>I. HOW CAN IT BE, METAPHYSICALLY, THAT WE DO<br /> INFLUENCE ONE
ANOTHER?</h4>

<p>First, then, how can it be that we do influence one another? What
is the final explanation of the constant fact of our reciprocal
action? For in our final thinking we may not ignore this question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36"
id="page_36">{36}</a></span> 1. <i>Not Due to the Physical Fact of
Race-Connection.</i>&mdash;It may be worth while saying, first, that the
physical fact of race-connection, if that could be proved, would be no
sufficient explanation. The race may, or may not, be dependent upon a
single pair, but in any case this is not the essential connection. The
race is one by virtue of its essential likeness, however that comes
about. Men might have sprung out of the ground in absolute individual
independence of one another, and yet if there were such actual
like-mindedness as now exists, the race would be as truly one as it
now is, and as capable of reciprocal action, and its members under the
same obligation to one another. No ideal interest is at stake, then,
in the question of the actual physical unity of the race as descended
from one pair.</p>

<p>One may say, of course, that the physical unity of the race would
naturally result, according to the laws apparently prevailing in the
animal world, in likeness. And this may, therefore, seem to him the
most natural proximate explanation. But, even so, it is well to know
that our entire <i>moral</i> interest is in the essential likeness and
mutual influence of men, however brought about, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> not in
the physical unity of men. Theology has no occasion to continue its
earlier excessive and quite fundamental emphasis upon this physical
unity. Moreover, such an explanation is necessarily but proximate.
Back of it lies the deeper question, Why just these laws, and modes of
procedure?</p>

<p>2. <i>We are not to Over-Emphasize the Principle of
Heredity.</i>&mdash;Nor can theology, from any point of view, afford to
over-emphasize the principle of heredity if it wishes to keep human
initiative at all. It is a dangerous alliance which the old-school
theology with its racial sin in Adam has been so ready to make with
the principle of heredity. That principle, as they wish to use it,
proves quite too much; and careful thinkers, really awake to ideal
interests, may well rejoice in the comparative relief which science
itself, through the probably somewhat exaggerated protest of the
Weismann or Neo-Darwinian school, seems likely to afford from the
incubus of a grossly exaggerated heredity. The main interest for the
ideal view lies right here. We can see why this law of the
"inheritance of acquired characteristics," in Professor James'
language, "<i>should not</i> be verified in the human race, and why,
therefore, in looking for evidence <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> on the subject, we should
confine ourselves exclusively to lower animals. In them fixed habit is
the essential and characteristic law of nervous action. The brain
grows to the exact modes in which it has been exercised, and the
inheritance of these modes&mdash;then called instincts&mdash;would have in it
nothing surprising. But in man the negation of all fixed modes is the
essential characteristic. He owes his whole preëminence as a reasoner,
his whole human quality of intellect, we may say, to the facility with
which a given mode of thought in him may suddenly be broken up into
elements, which re-combine anew. Only at the price of inheriting no
settled instinctive tendencies is he able to settle every novel case
by the fresh discovery by his reason of novel principles. He is,
<i>par excellence</i>, the educable animal."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_18" id="R_18" href="#F_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>To over-emphasize the principle of heredity, then, is to strike at
one of the most fundamental distinctive human qualities, and so to
endanger every ideal interest. The growing like-mindedness of men and
their mutual influence are not forthwith to be ascribed to an
omnipotent principle of heredity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39"
id="page_39">{39}</a></span> 3. <i>Not Due to a Mystical
Solidarity.</i>&mdash;Nor is the mutual influence of men to be explained by
any mystical solidarity of the race considered as a <i>finite</i>
whole. It is a simple and reasonable scientific demand, that we should
not assume a mysterious, indefinable and incalculable cause, where
known and intelligible causes suffice to explain the phenomena in
question. Do we need, or can we intelligently use, a mystical
solidarity? The only solidarity of the race which we seem really to
need, or with which we seem able intelligently to deal, is the actual
like-mindedness and the actual personal relations themselves&mdash;the
reciprocal action of spirits&mdash;the only kind of reciprocal action which
we can finally fully conceive. Any other finite solidarity than this,
though it has often figured in theology, seems to me only a name
without significance. In any case, we need to insist in theology, much
more than we have, upon that unity of the race which is due to the
actual likeness of men and their actual mutual personal influence.
Such a unity we know and can understand, and it is of the highest
ethical and spiritual importance. But to make much of the physical
unity is to ground the spiritual in the physical; and, on <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> the
other hand, to take refuge in a mystical solidarity&mdash;and this is often
felt to be a rather deep procedure&mdash;for whatever theological purpose,
is to hide in the fog of the obscure and unintelligible.</p>

<p>4. <i>Grounded in the Immanence of God.</i>&mdash;But back of all finite
phenomena, we may still ask for an ultimate explanation of the
possibility of any reciprocal action even between spirits. And it is,
perhaps, this ultimate explanation after which the idea of a mystical
solidarity of the race is blindly groping. Unless one chooses to
accept reciprocal action as a necessarily given fact in any universe
(and this position, I think with F. C. S. Schiller, may be reasonably
defended),<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_19" id="R_19"
href="#F_19">[19]</a></span> he must somewhere in his thinking ask for
its final explanation. And most of those, who try to think things
through, feel this pressure. And metaphysics, we do well to remember
with Professor James, "means only an unusually obstinate attempt to
think clearly and consistently."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_20"
id="R_20" href="#F_20">[20]</a></span> As Lotze puts it: "How a cause
begins to produce its <i>immediate</i> effect, how a condition is the
foundation of its direct result, it will never be possible to say; yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span>
that cause and effect <i>do</i> thus act must be reckoned among those
simple facts that compose the reality which is the object of all our
investigation. But there is an intolerable contradiction in the
assumption that, though two beings may be wholly independent the one
of the other, yet that which takes place in one can be a cause of
change in the other; things that do not affect each other at all,
cannot at the same time affect each other in such a manner that the
one is guided by the other."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_21"
id="R_21" href="#F_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This question is fairly thrust upon us by the facts of the social
consciousness. How can it be that we do so influence one another? how
is our reciprocal action metaphysically possible? The answer of
theistic philosophy to this question is found in the being of God.</p>

<p>Upon the metaphysical side, theistic philosophy affirms that we can
ascribe independent existence in the highest sense only to God. All
else is absolutely dependent for its existence and maintenance upon
him. The kind of reality that we demand for man is not that he be
<i>outside</i> of God, independent of him; this would not make man
more, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42"
id="page_42">{42}</a></span> but less. Every thorough-going theistic
view must have this at least in common with pantheism, that it
recognizes everywhere a real immanence of God. We are, because God
wills in us. This metaphysical relation of the finite to the infinite,
to be sure, is not to be conceived spatially or materially; nor, least
of all, is it be so conceived as to deny a real self-consciousness and
a real moral initiative to the finite spirit; but it does involve the
absolute dependence of all the finite upon the will of God. As to our
<i>being</i>, we root solely in God. And the unity and consistency of
the being of God are the actual ground of our possible reciprocal
action. Only so is that contradiction of which Lotze spoke avoided. We
are not independent of one another, because we are all alike dependent
for our very being upon God. And we are thus members one of another,
ultimately, only through him.</p>

<p>The further fact, that we are never fully able to trace causal
connections anywhere; that even in the clearest case no possible
analysis of one stage in the process enables us to prophesy,
independently of experience, the next stage, also compels us to admit
that the full cause is not really present in any of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> the
finite manifestations we can follow; that we have always to take
account of the "hidden efficacy of the Infinite everywhere at work,"
and so must recognize once again the indubitable immanence of God, the
absolute dependence of the finite upon his will, and our reciprocal
action as possible only through him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_22" id="R_22" href="#F_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, to put the same thing a little differently, any adequate theory
of causality seems to lead us up inevitably to purpose in God. As
Professor Bowne states it:<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_23"
id="R_23" href="#F_23">[23]</a></span> "The fundamental antithesis of
purpose and causation is incorrect. The true antithesis is that of
mechanical and volitional causality." And he intimates the probability
that all causality, even in the physical world, is ultimately
volitional. "It becomes a question," he says, "whether true causality
can be found in the phenomenal at all, and not rather in a power
beyond the phenomenal which incessantly posits and continues that
order according to rule." The unity and consistency of the immanent
will of God, then, are the ultimate metaphysical ground of all
reciprocal action. The mutual influence, that is, even <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> of
spirits, finds its final full explanation only in God.</p>

<p>The social consciousness, therefore, so far as it is an expression
of the possibility and inevitableness of our mutual influence, is a
reflection of the immanence of the one God in the unity and
consistency of his life.</p>

<p>But this, after all, is not the most important element of the
social consciousness. So far as it is <i>ethical</i> at all, it can
have no final explanation in the metaphysical, considered as mere
matter of fact. We are driven, therefore, to ask the second question
involved in the subject of the chapter.</p>

<h4>II. WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE FINAL POSITIVE JUSTIFICATION<br />
OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS ETHICAL?</h4>

<p>1. <i>Must be Grounded in the Supporting Will of God.</i>&mdash;It is
not enough that we should be able to think of the unity of One Life
pervading all, or even of One Will upholding all. If the social
consciousness, as distinctly ethical, is to have any final
justification, it must be able to believe that it is in league with
the eternal and universal forces; that the fundamental trend of the
universe is its <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45"
id="page_45">{45}</a></span> own trend; in other words, that the
deepest thing in the universe is an ethical purpose conceivable only
in a Person; that the ideals and purposes of finite beings expressed
in the social consciousness are in line with God's own; that the
loving holy purpose of the Infinite Will quickens and sustains and
surrounds our purposes.</p>

<p>Let us distinctly face the fact that, unless the social
consciousness can be so grounded in the very foundation of the
universe, it must remain an illogical and unjustifiable fragment in
the world, without real excuse for being. That is, if the social
consciousness is not to be an illusion, it must be, as Professor Nash
contends, cosmical, and not merely individual, and ethics must root in
religion. This is the very heart of his stimulating book, <i>Ethics
and Revelation</i>, expressed, for example, in such sentences as
these: "Nothing save a sense of deep and intimate connection with the
solid core of things, nothing save a settled and fervid conviction
that the universe is on the side of the will in its struggle for that
whole-hearted devotion for the welfare of the race, without which
morality is an affair of shreds and patches, can give to the will the
force and edge suitable to the difficult <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> work it has to do. But
this sense of kinship with what is deepest and most abiding in the
universe&mdash;what else is meant by pure religion." And again: "We, as
founders and builders of the true society, find ourselves shut up to
an impassioned faith in the sincerity of the universe and the
integrity of the fundamental being. Our religion is a deep and wide
synthesis of feeling, whereby that personal will in us, which grounds
society, comes into solemn league and covenant with the fundamental
being. Here is the focus-point of the prophetic revelation. At this
point, the deep in God answers to the deep in Man.... All that He is
He puts in pledge for the perfecting of the society He has
founded."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_24" id="R_24"
href="#F_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Paulsen expresses only the same fundamental conviction, from the
point of view of the philosopher, and, at the same time, the heart of
his own solution of the relation between knowledge and faith, when he
says: "There is one item, at least, in which every man goes beyond
mere knowledge, beyond the registration of facts. That is his own life
and his future. His life has a meaning for him, and he directs it
toward something <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47"
id="page_47">{47}</a></span> which does not yet exist, but which will
exist by virtue of his will. Thus a faith springs up by the side of
his knowledge. He believes in the realization of this, his life's aim,
if he is at all in earnest about it. Since, however, his aim is not an
isolated one, but is included in the historical life of a people, and
finally in that of humanity, he believes also in the future of his
people, in the victorious future of truth and righteousness and
goodness in humanity. Whoever devotes his life to a cause believes in
that cause, and this belief, be his creed what it may, has always
something of the form of a religion. Hence faith infers that an inner
connection exists between the real and the valuable within the domain
of history, and believes that in history something like an immanent
principle of reason or justice favors the right and the good, and
leads it to victory over all resisting forces." And Paulsen holds that
this implicit faith characterizes necessarily every philosophical
theory. "What the philosopher himself accepts as the highest good and
final goal he projects into the world as its good and goal, and then
believes that subsequent reflections also reveal it to him in the
world."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_25" id="R_25"
href="#F_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48"
id="page_48">{48}</a></span> We must be able, then, to believe that
the best we know&mdash;our highest ideals&mdash;are at home in the world, or
give up all faith in the honesty of the world, and all hope of
philosophy, to say nothing of religion. Ultimately, now, this means
that nothing short of full Christian conviction is needed to support
the social consciousness. We need to be able to believe that the
spirit of the life and death of Christ is at the very heart of the
world. Nothing less will suffice. And this is exactly the support
which the Christian revelation offers to the social consciousness.</p>

<p>2. <i>God's Sharing in Our Life.</i>&mdash;But if the social
consciousness is only a true reflection of God's own desire and
purpose, then in a sense far deeper than the merely metaphysical, our
life is the very life of God. He shares in it. And no man can really
see what that means, and not find a new light falling on all the
world, and himself carried on to take up a new confession of faith in
the solemn words of another: "For the agony of the world's struggle is
the very life of God. Were he mere spectator, perhaps, he too would
call life cruel. But in the unity of our lives with his, our joy is
his joy, our pain is his." And from the vision of this <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span>
self-giving life of God we turn back to our own place of service,
saying with Matheson: "If Thou art love then Thy best gift must be
sacrifice; in that light let me search Thy world."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_26" id="R_26"
href="#F_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>We probably cannot better express this unity of our highest ethical
life with the life of God than by renewing our old faith that we are
children of a common Father, who have come, under God's own
leading&mdash;so far as a social consciousness is ours&mdash;voluntarily to
share in God's loving purpose in the creation and redemption of men.
We do not work alone; nay, we are co-workers with God.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Consequent Transfiguration of the Social
Consciousness.</i>&mdash;And as soon as we have thus really and deeply come
into the meaning of Christ's thought of God as Father, and into his
revelation in his life and death as to what the spirit of that
Fatherhood is, we turn back to the elements of our social
consciousness to find them all transfigured.</p>

<p>Our <i>likeness</i> is the likeness of common children of God
reflecting the image of the one Father, capable of character and of
indefinite progress into the highest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50"
id="page_50">{50}</a></span> Our <i>mutual influence</i> roots in a
real Fatherhood, both in source of being and in the one purpose of
love, alike creating and redemptively working for all.</p>

<p>Our <i>sense of the value and sacredness of the person</i> now for
the first time gets its full justification. Men are not only creatures
capable of joying and suffering, but children of God with a
preciousness to be interpreted only in the light of Christ, and with
the "power of the endless life" upon them. Concerning the value of the
person, it is worth stopping just here, to notice that it is
peculiarly true of the social consciousness, that it is not free to
ignore such considerations upon immortality as those which weighed
most with John Stuart Mill and Sully. Of the hope of immortality, Mill
says: "The beneficial influence of such a hope is far from trifling.
It makes life and human nature a far greater thing to the feelings,
and gives greater strength as well as greater solemnity to all the
sentiments which are awakened in us by our fellow-creatures, and by
mankind at large." And Sully adds: "I would only say that if men are
to abandon all hope of a future life, the loss, in point of cheering
and sustaining influence, will be a vast one, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> one not
to be made good, so far as I can see, by any new idea of services to
collective humanity."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_27" id="R_27"
href="#F_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Our <i>sense of obligation</i> deepens with all this deepening of
the value of men, and our conscience becomes only a true response to
God's own life and character&mdash;in no mere figurative sense the voice of
God in us.</p>

<p>And our <i>love</i> becomes simply entering a little way into God's
own love, a sharing more and more in his life.</p>

<p>And when one has once seen the social consciousness so transfigured
in the light of Christ's revelation, he must believe that then, for
the first time, he has seen the social consciousness at its highest,
and that it is impossible for him to go back to the lower ideal. If
the social consciousness is not an illusion, Christ's thought of God
and of the life with God ought to be true; and if the world is an
honest world, it is true. It is not only true that Christ has a social
teaching, but that the social consciousness absolutely requires
Christ's teaching for its own final justification. The Christian truth
<i>is</i> so great that it alone can give the social consciousness its
fullest <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52"
id="page_52">{52}</a></span> meaning, alone can enable it to
understand itself, and alone can give it adequate motive and power;
for, in Keim's words, "to-day, to-morrow, and forever we can know
nothing better than that God is our Father, and that the Father is the
rest of our souls."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_28" id="R_28"

<h2>THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS<br />
UPON THE CONCEPTION OF RELIGION</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the question of the support which
Christian faith and doctrine give to the social consciousness, we turn
now to the second part of our inquiry: How does this growing social
consciousness, not by any means always consciously religious,
naturally react upon and affect our conceptions of religion and of
theological doctrines?</p>

<p>In this inquiry, we cannot always be sure historically of the exact
connection, and, for our present purpose, this is not of prime
importance. But we can see, for example, in this second division of
our theme, the relations of religion and the social consciousness, and
how religion must be conceived if the social consciousness is fully
warranted; and this is the main question.</p>

<p>If the definition of theology which has <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> been suggested be
adopted&mdash;the thoughtful and unified expression of what religion means
to us&mdash;then it is obvious that any change in conception or emphasis in
religion will necessarily affect theological statement. Our inquiry as
to the influence of the social consciousness, therefore, naturally
begins with religion.</p>

<p>The discussions of this division, moreover, will really include all
that part of theological doctrine which has to do with the growth into
the life with God.</p>

<p>The natural influence of the social consciousness upon the
conception of religion may be, perhaps, summed up in four points,
which form the subjects of the four succeeding chapters: (1) The
social consciousness tends to draw religion away from the falsely
mystical; (2) it tends to emphasize the personal relation in religion,
and so keeps the truly mystical; (3) it tends to emphasize the ethical
in religion; (4) it tends to emphasize the concretely historically
Christian in religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55"
id="page_55">{55}</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE OPPOSITION
OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO<br />THE FALSELY
MYSTICAL</i></span></h3>

<h4>I. WHAT IS THE FALSELY MYSTICAL?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> very clear answers made from
different points of view deserve attention.</p>

<p>1. <i>Nash's Definition.</i>&mdash;In trying to set forth the "main mood
and motives of religious speculation" in the early Christian
centuries, Professor Nash takes, as perhaps the two strongest
influences in determining the type of man to whom Christian
apologetics had then to appeal, Philo and Plotinus, and says: "By what
road shall the mind enter into a deep and intimate knowledge of God?
That is the decisive question. Plotinus the Gentile and Philo the Jew
are at one in their answer. The reason must rise above reasoning. It
must pass into a state that is half a swoon and half an ecstasy before
it can truly know God. Philo gave up for the sake of his theory, the
position of the prophets. Plotinus, for the same theory, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> forsook
the position of Plato and Aristotle. The prophets conceived the inmost
essence of things, the being and will of God, as a creative and
redemptive force that guided and revealed itself through the career of
a great national community. Plato and Aristotle conceived the essence
of life as a labor of reason; and, for them, the labors of reason
found their sufficient refreshment and inspiration in those moments of
clear synthesis which are the reward of patient analysis. Revelation
came to the prophet through his experience of history. To the
philosopher it came through hard and steady thinking. But Philo and
Plotinus together declared these roads to be no thoroughfares. The
Greek and the Jew met on the common ground of a mysticism that
sacrificed the needs of sober reason and the needs of the nation to
the necessities of the monk."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_29"
id="R_29" href="#F_29">[29]</a></span> Mysticism is here conceived as
unethical, unhistorical, and unrational.</p>

<p>2. <i>Herrmann's Definition.</i>&mdash;Herrmann's definition of
mysticism is the second one to which attention is directed. He says:
"When the influence of God upon the soul is sought and found solely in
an inward experience of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57"
id="page_57">{57}</a></span> individual; when certain excitements of
the emotions are taken, with no further question, as evidence that the
soul is possessed by God; when, at the same time, nothing external to
the soul is consciously and clearly perceived and firmly grasped; when
no thoughts that elevate the spiritual life are aroused by the
positive contents of an idea that rules the soul&mdash;then that is the
piety of mysticism. He who seeks in this wise that for the sake of
which he is ready to abandon all beside, has stepped beyond the pale
of Christian piety. He leaves Christ and Christ's Kingdom altogether
behind him when he enters that sphere of experience which seems to him
to be the highest."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_30" id="R_30"
href="#F_30">[30]</a></span> The marks of mysticism for Herrmann,
then, are: that it is purely subjective; that it is merely emotional
and unethical; and hence that it has no clear object, and is abstract,
unrational, unhistorical, and so unchristian.</p>

<h4>II. THE OBJECTIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS<br />
TO THE FALSELY MYSTICAL</h4>

<p>Against this neo-platonic, falsely mystical conception of religion,
the social consciousness <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58"
id="page_58">{58}</a></span> seems to be clearly arrayed, and, so far
as the social consciousness influences religion, it will certainly
tend to draw it away from this falsely mystical idea.</p>

<p>1. <i>Unethical.</i>&mdash;For, in the first place, this neo-platonic
conception of religion has nothing distinctly ethical in it. The
ethical is manifestly not made the test of true religious experience,
as it is in the New Testament. The social consciousness, on the other
hand, is predominantly and emphatically ethical, and can have nothing
to do with a religion in which ethics is either omitted or is wholly
subordinate. At this point, therefore, the pressure of the social
consciousness is strongly against a neo-platonic mysticism.</p>

<p>2. <i>Does not Give a Real Personal God.</i>&mdash;In the second place,
the social consciousness cannot get along with the falsely mystical,
because it does not give a real personal God. Let us be clear upon
this point. Is not Herrmann right when he says that all that can be
said of the God of this mysticism is "that he is not the world? Now
that is precisely all that mysticism has ever been able to say of God
as it conceives him. Plainly, the world and the conception of it are
all that moves the soul while it thinks thus of God. Only <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
disappointment can ensue to the soul whose yearning for God in such
case keeps on insisting that God must be something utterly different
from the world. If such a soul will reflect awhile on the nature of
the God thus reached, the fact must inevitably come to the surface
that its whole consciousness is occupied with the world now as it was
before, for evidently it has grasped no positive ideas&mdash;nothing but
negative ideas&mdash;about anything else. Mysticism frequently passes into
pantheism for this very reason, even in men of the highest religious
energy; they refuse to be satisfied with the mere longing after God,
or to remain on the way to him, but determine to reach the goal
itself, and rest with God himself."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_31" id="R_31" href="#F_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we have already seen that the social consciousness can find
adequate support and power and motive only in faith that its purpose
is God's purpose, that the deepest thing in the universe is an ethical
purpose, conceivable only in a personal God; and, therefore, neither
an empty negation nor pantheism can ever satisfy it.</p>

<p>3. <i>Belittles the Personal in Man.</i>&mdash;The false mysticism,
moreover, belittles the personal in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> man as well as in God; for
it does not treat with real reverence either the personality, the
ethical freedom, the sense of obligation, or the reason of man. This
whole thought of "a state that is half a swoon and half an ecstasy" is
a sort of swamping of clear self-consciousness and definite moral
initiative, in which the very reality of man's personality consists.
It is a heathen, not a Christian, idea of inspiration which demands
the suppression of the human, whether in consciousness, in will, in
reason, or by belittling the sense of obligation to others. But
mysticism has at least tended toward failure in all these
respects.</p>

<p>And yet, from the time that Paul argued with the Corinthians
against their immense overestimation of the gift of speaking with
tongues, this fascination of the merely mystical has been felt in
Christianity. (1) The very mystery and unintelligibility of the
experience, (2) its ecstatic emotion, (3) its sense of being
controlled by a power beyond one's self, and (4) its contrast with
ordinary life&mdash;all these elements make the mystical experience seem to
most all the more divine, although in so judging they are applying a
pagan, not a Christian, standard. So far as these experiences <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> have
value, it is probably due to the strong and realistic sense which they
give of being in the presence of an overpowering being. If thoroughly
permeated and dominated with other elements, this sense is not without
its value.</p>

<p>But it is interesting to notice that, although Paul does not deny
the legitimacy of the gift of speaking with tongues, he nevertheless
absolutely subordinates it, and insists that the most ecstatic
religious emotions are completely worthless without love. Evidently
the considerations which weighed most with the Corinthians in valuing
the gift of unintelligible ecstatic utterance weighed little with
Paul; and one can see how Paul implicitly argues against each of those
considerations: (1) God is not an unknown, mystic force, but the
definite, concrete God of character, shown in Christ. (2) He speaks to
reason and will as well as to feeling, and he best speaks to feeling
when he speaks to the whole man. True religious emotion must have a
rational basis and must move to duty. (3) Religion, he would urge, is
a self-controlled and voluntary surrender to a personal God of
character, not a passive being swept away by an unknown emotion. (4)
God has most to give, be assured, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> he would have added, in
the <i>common</i> ways of life.</p>

<p>Now, in every one of these protests, the social consciousness
instinctively joins. It cannot rest in a conception of religion that
belittles the personal in God or man; for it is itself an emphatic
insistence upon the fully personal. And it can, least of all, get on
with the mystical ignoring of the rational and the ethical, for it
holds that the social evolution moves steadily on to a rational
like-mindedness, and to a definitely ethical civilization. Giddings
puts the sociological conclusion in a sentence: "It is the rational,
ethical consciousness that maintains social cohesion in a progressive
democracy."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_32" id="R_32"
href="#F_32">[32]</a></span> Now that which is clearly recognized as
the goal in the relations of man to man will not be set aside as
unwarranted or subordinate in the relations of man to God. And we may
depend upon it.</p>

<p>4. <i>Leaves the Historically, Concretely Christian.</i>&mdash;Once
more, the social consciousness cannot approve of the mystical
conception of religion in its ignoring, in its highest state, the
historically and concretely Christian. With mysticism's subjective,
emotional, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63"
id="page_63">{63}</a></span> abstract conception of the highest
communion with God, and of the way thereto, the historical and
concrete at best can be to it only subordinate means, more or less
mysteriously connected with the attainment of the goal, and left
behind when once the goal is reached.</p>

<p>The social consciousness, on the other hand, requires historical
justification, and definitely builds on the facts of the historical
social evolution.</p>

<p>In the case of the prophets and psalmists, for example, who alone
in the ancient world most fully anticipated the modern social feeling,
the social consciousness plainly arose in the face of the concrete
historical life of a people. No result of modern Old Testament
criticism is more certain. So that, speaking of "the religious aspects
of the social struggle in Israel," McCurdy can use this strong
language: "It is not too much to say that this conflict, intense,
uninterrupted, and prolonged, is the very heart of the religion of the
Old Testament, its most regenerative and propulsive movement. To the
personal life of the soul, the only basis of a potential, world-moving
religion, it gave energy and depth, assurance and hopefulness, repose
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64"
id="page_64">{64}</a></span> self-control, with an outlook clear and
eternal."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_33" id="R_33"
href="#F_33">[33]</a></span> But it was this standpoint of the
prophets that the falsely mystical conception of religion abandoned.
We may well take to heart, in our estimate of mysticism, the gradual
but steady elimination of ecstasy in the development of Israel, and
its practically total absence in those we count in the highest sense
prophets.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_34" id="R_34"
href="#F_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The social consciousness, moreover, has almost entirely to do with
men, and hence naturally must lay stress on human history, rather than
on nature, as a source of religious ideas. Indeed, it will have no
doubt that what nature is made to mean religiously will be chiefly
determined by the prevalent social ideals. It can, therefore, least of
all ignore the historical in Christianity.</p>

<p>The social consciousness recognizes increasingly, too, with the
clearing of its own ideals and with the deepening study of the
teaching of Jesus, that it really is only demanding, in the concrete,
and in detailed application to particular problems, and to all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>
them, the spirit shown in its fullness only in Christ, as Professor
Peabody's eminently sane treatment of the social teaching of Jesus
seems to me fairly to have proven. The social consciousness,
therefore, cannot help becoming more and more consciously and
emphatically Christian.</p>

<p>In a single sentence, because of the steps of its own long
evolution, the social consciousness instinctively distrusts the highly
emotional, unless it is manifestly under equally strong rational
control, and unless it has equal ethical insight and power, and is
historically justified. It tends, therefore, necessarily to draw away
from the falsely mystical in religion, which is lacking in all these
respects.</p>

<p>And the same reasons, which array the social consciousness against
the falsely mystical in religion, lead it into natural sympathy with a
positive emphasis upon the personal, the ethical, and the historically
concretely Christian in religion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE EMPHASIS
OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS UPON <br />THE PERSONAL RELATION IN
RELIGION, AND<br />SO UPON THE TRULY MYSTICAL</i></span></h3>

<h4>I. THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS TENDS POSITIVELY TO EMPHASIZE<br />
THE PERSONAL RELATION IN RELIGION</h4>

<p>1. <i>Emphasizes Everywhere the Personal.</i>&mdash;The social
consciousness sees man as preëminently the social animal, made for
personal relations, irrevocably and essentially knit up with other
persons. It deepens everywhere our sense of persons and of personal
relations. It may be itself almost defined as the sense of the fully
personal.</p>

<p>Religion, then, if it is to be most real to men of the social
consciousness, must be personally conceived, that is, must be
distinctly seen to be a personal relation of man to God. And this
conception, as the highest we can reach, is to be followed fearlessly
to the end; only guarding it against wrong inferences from the simple
transference to God of finite conditions, and recognizing exactly in
what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67"
id="page_67">{67}</a></span> respects the personal relation to God is
unique.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_35" id="R_35"
href="#F_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The social consciousness, moreover, as we have seen, must have a
conception of religion that can really justify the social
consciousness, and, therefore, must do justice to the fully personal
in God and man; and this need also leads the social consciousness
naturally to the conception of religion as a personal relation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Requires the Laws of a Deepening Friendship in
Religion.</i>&mdash;When this conception is carried out, it is found that
growth in the religious life, in communion with God, follows the laws
of a deepening friendship.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_36"
id="R_36" href="#F_36">[36]</a></span> These laws can, therefore, be
known and studied and formulated; and religion, at the same time,
ceases to be unintelligible and ceases to be isolated&mdash;cut off from
the rest of life, and becomes rather that one great fundamental
relation which gives being and meaning and value to all the rest. In
absolute harmony, then, with the genesis of the social consciousness,
religion, in this conception, is bound up with the whole of life; and
we catch a glimpse of the real and final unity <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> of life
in true love, the relation to God and the relation to man each helping
everywhere the other. If religion is truly a personal relation, and
its laws are those of a deepening friendship, then every human
relation, heartily and truly fulfilled, becomes a new outlook on God,
a revelation of new possibilities in the religious life. And, on the
other hand, in that mutual self-revelation and answering trust upon
which every growing personal relation is built, every fresh revelation
of God is an enlarging of our ideal for our relations to others. Even
biblical literature, perhaps, furnishes no more perfect example of the
interplay of the human and divine relations than Hosea's account of
his own providential leading through the human relation into the
divine, and back again from the divine to a still better human.</p>

<p>3. <i>Requires the Ideal Conditions of the Richest Life in
Religion.</i>&mdash;And if religion is to be justified in its supreme
claims by the social consciousness, it must be felt to offer, besides,
the ideal conditions of the richest life. As a personal relation to
God, religion need not shrink from this test. Our great needs are
character and happiness. Psychology seems to me to point to two great
means and to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69"
id="page_69">{69}</a></span> two accompanying conditions of both
character and happiness. The means are association and work; the
corresponding conditions are reverence for personality, and
objectivity&mdash;the mood of both love and work. The great essentials,
therefore, to the richest life are (1) association in which
personality is respected, and (2) work in which one can lose himself.
Now, when would these conditions become ideal? On the one hand, as to
association, when the association is with him who is of the highest
character and of the infinitely richest life, and relation to whom is
fundamental to every other personal relation; when, secondly, God is
made concrete and real to us in an adequate personal revelation of his
character, and of his love toward us; and when, third, the association
is individualized for each one, who throws himself open to God, in
God's spiritual presence in us, constantly and intimately, and yet
<i>unobtrusively</i>, coöperating with us. And, on the other hand, as
to work, when the work is God-given work, to which one is set apart,
and in which he may lose himself with joy. These are the ideal
conditions of the richest life. Just these ideal conditions Jesus
declared actualities. For the fulfilment of just these, in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span>
of his disciples, he prayed in his double petition,&mdash;"Keep them,"
"Sanctify them," "Keep them in thy name," that is, through the divine
association. "Sanctify them"&mdash;set them apart unto their God-given
work. "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world." Such a conception of religion can fairly claim
to meet, broadly and deeply, the most exacting demands of the social
consciousness for emphasis upon the personal relation in religion.</p>

<h4>II. THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS THUS KEEPS THE TRULY MYSTICAL</h4>

<p>I have no predilection for the term mystical, and would gladly
confine it to what I have termed the neo-platonic or falsely mystical,
were it not that, in spite of the dictionaries and the histories of
philosophy and the histories of doctrine, the term is used in two
quite different senses. Many, it seems to me, are defending what they
call the mystical in religion, who have no idea of defending what
Herrmann and Nash call mystical. And many, on the other hand, are
defending and teaching the falsely mystical through an undefined fear
that else they will lose the truly <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> mystical. Theology and
religion both greatly need a clear discrimination of terms here. Many
are involved, in both living and thinking, in a self-contradiction,
which they feel but cannot state; and are urging with themselves and
with others a means of religious life and a corresponding method of
conception, which really contradict their highest convictions in other
lines of life and thought. Can we find our way out of this
confusion?</p>

<p>If one studies carefully the historical representatives of
mysticism, and especially such a strong type as Jacob Böhme, whom
Erdmann calls the "culmination of mysticism," and still keeps his
head, certain dangers in mysticism, it would seem, must become
apparent. And it may be worth while to attempt a brief, but definite,
analysis of the justifiable and unjustifiable elements in these
mystical movements.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Justifiable and Unjustifiable Elements in
Mysticism.</i>&mdash;(1) The first danger in mysticism seems to me to be
the tendency to make simple emotion the supreme test of the religious
state. Whether this emotion is thought of as ecstatic&mdash;such as some of
the old mystics called "being drunk with God," or, as quietistic&mdash;in
which imperturbability, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72"
id="page_72">{72}</a></span> passionlessness, become the highest
good&mdash;is comparatively indifferent. The justifiable element here is
the insistence that religion is real and is life; for feeling is
perhaps the most powerful element in the sense of reality. So James
says: "Speaking generally, the more a conceived object excites us, the
more reality it has."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_37" id="R_37"
href="#F_37">[37]</a></span> The unjustifiable element is the perilous
subjection of the rational and ethical. Such a view must always lack
any positive and adequate conception of our active life and vocation
in the world.</p>

<p>(2) A second closely connected danger in mysticism is the tendency
toward mere subjectivism. There is here a justifiable element in the
emphasis on one's own personal conviction and faith; an unjustifiable
element in the tendency to underrate anything but the purely
subjective, to ignore all correcting influences from others, from the
church, and from the Scriptures.</p>

<p>(3) A third danger follows from this: the marked tendency to
underestimate the historical. The justifiable element here is, again,
the emphasis on personal conviction and faith; the unjustifiable
element is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73"
id="page_73">{73}</a></span> tendency toward the greatest
one-sidedness, and toward emptiness, especially of ethical content.
Advising our young people simply to "listen to God," without the
strongest insistence upon the historical revelation of God at the same
time, is exposing them to the great danger of mistaking for an
indubitable, divine revelation the veriest vagary that may chance in
their empty-mindedness next to come into their thought. With the
reason in supposed abeyance, the door is thus thrown open to the
grossest superstitions. Honest attempts to deepen the religious life
may thus become dangerous assaults upon true religion.</p>

<p>(4) A fourth danger in mysticism is so strong a tendency toward
vagueness, that the common mind is not without warrant in identifying
mysticism and mistiness. The justifiable element here is in the real
difficulty of expressing the full content of the entire religious
experience; the unjustifiable element is, once more, the slighting of
the historical, the ethical, and the rational, especially in talking
much of the contradictions of reason, and of what is above reason.
Mysticism naturally lacks positive content.</p>

<p>(5) Another danger&mdash;the tendency toward <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> pantheism&mdash;comes in
partly, as Herrmann has suggested, as a meeting of this lack of
content, and partly as the logical outcome of such an insistence upon
losing oneself in God as amounts to a being swept out of one's self&mdash;a
loss of clear and rational self-consciousness, which is next
interpreted speculatively as a real absorption in God, and is then
made the goal. This is the familiar road of Indian and neo-platonic
mysticism, and its phenomena are real enough, but probably of only the
slightest religious significance. Tennyson tells somewhere of the
immense sense of illumination that came to him once from simply
repeating monotonously his own name&mdash;"Alfred Tennyson, Alfred
Tennyson." This may be as effective as looking at the end of one's
nose and ceaselessly reiterating "Om," as does the Hindu ascetic. A
still shorter and more certain method is through nitrous-oxide-gas
intoxication, of which Professor James says: "With me, as with every
other person of whom I have heard, the key-note of the experience is
the tremendously exciting sense of an intense metaphysical
illumination. Truth lies open to the view in depth beneath depth of
almost blinding evidence. The mind sees all the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> logical
relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaneity, to
which its normal consciousness offers no parallel; only as sobriety
returns, the feeling of insight fades, and one is left staring
vacantly at a few disjointed words and phrases as one stares at a
cadaverous-looking snow-peak from which the sunset glow has just fled,
or at the black cinder left by an extinguished brand." "The immense
emotional sense of reconciliation," he felt to be the characteristic
mood. "It is impossible to convey," he says, "an idea of the
torrential character of the identification of opposites as it streams
through the mind in this experience."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_38" id="R_38" href="#F_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it is not safe to ignore such facts, when we are seriously
trying to estimate the religious significance of intense emotional
experiences, the reality of which we need not at all question. The
vital question is, not that of the reality of the experiences, but
that of the real cause of the experiences; and the only possible test
of this is rational and ethical. But from this test, mysticism tends
from the start to shut itself off, and so, assuming the experience to
be truly religious, ends often in virtual pantheism.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span>
The justifiable element in this insistence upon absorption in God is
the necessary moral relation of complete surrender to God. The
unjustifiable element is in belittling the personal in both God and
man, and in making essentially religious an experience that has almost
nothing of the rational and ethical in it, and that, on that very
account, fosters the irreverent familiarity with Christ so deplored by
more than one careful student of mysticism. A natural and common and
most dangerous accompaniment of such an intense emotional experience
is the tendency afterward, to excuse sin in oneself. In the case of
the most conscientious, it is worth noting, such an emphasis upon
intense experiences tends to lead them to distrust the reality of the
normal Christian experience if they have not had these intense
emotions, or if they have had them, tends to bring them into despair
when they find these marked experiences actually proving less powerful
in effects upon life than they had expected.</p>

<p>(6) The last danger in mysticism, to which reference will be made,
is the tendency to extravagant symbolism. This is closely connected
with "the immense emotional sense of reconciliation," and is much
stronger by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77"
id="page_77">{77}</a></span> nature in some than in others. The born
mystic finds his own subjective views symbolized everywhere, and is in
grave danger of being led into an ingenious, practically unconscious
intellectual dishonesty. The justifiable element here is that sense of
the unity and worth of things which is the most fundamental conviction
of our minds. The unjustifiable element has been sufficiently
indicated.</p>

<p>The justifiable elements in mysticism, then, may be said to
include: the insistence on the legitimate place of feeling in religion
as a real and vital experience; the emphasis on one's own conviction
and faith; the real difficulty of expressing the full meaning of the
religious experience; the demand for a complete ethical surrender to
God; and the faith in the real unity and worth of the world in God.
Now if one tries to bring together these justifiable elements in
mysticism, the truly mystical may all be summed up as simply a protest
in favor of the whole man&mdash;the entire personality. It says that men
can experience and live and feel and do much more than they can
logically formulate, define, explain, or even fully express. Living is
more than thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78"
id="page_78">{78}</a></span> 2. <i>The Protest in Favor of the Whole
Man.</i>&mdash;The element to which mysticism has tried most to do justice
is feeling, and so it has been liable to a new and dangerous
one-sidedness. But the truly mystical must be a protest alike against
a narrow juiceless intellectualism, against a narrow moralistic
rigorism, and against a blind and spineless sentimentalism. It is a
protest particularly against making the mathematico-mechanical view of
the world the only view; against making logical consistency the sole
test of truth or reality; against ignoring all data, except those
which come through the intellect alone; that is, against trying to
make a part, not the whole, of man the standard; in other words,
against ignoring the data which come through feeling and
will&mdash;emotional, æsthetic, ethical, and religious data, as well as
those judgments of worth which underlie reason's theoretical
determinations.</p>

<p>Man stands, in fact, everywhere face to face with an actual world
of great complexity, that seems to him at first what James says the
baby's world is, "one big blooming buzzing confusion;" "and the
universe of all of us is still to a great extent such a confusion,
potentially resolvable, and demanding to be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span> resolved, but not yet
actually resolved, into parts."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_39"
id="R_39" href="#F_39">[39]</a></span> In one sense, man's whole task
is to think unity and order into this confusion. The problem really
becomes that of thinking the universe through in several kinds of
terms, and then finally bringing all together into one comprehensive
view. All these are alike ideals which the mind sets before itself.
The easiest of these problems is the attempt to think the world
through, in mathematico-mechanical terms. But the attempt to think the
world through in æsthetic or ethical or religious terms is equally
legitimate, though it is more difficult. Not only, then, is the
mathematico-mechanical view not the sole justifiable view, but it
really has its justification in an ideal, and success in this attempt
affords just encouragement for the hope of success in the other more
difficult problems.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_40" id="R_40"
href="#F_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The truly mystical holds, then, that the narrow intellectualism is
unwarranted, because natural science, the mechanical view of the
world, is itself an ideal&mdash;the "child of duties," as Münsterberg calls
it&mdash;and so cannot legitimately rule out other ideals; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> because
we have just as immediate a conviction concerning the worth, as
concerning the logical consistency of the world; because a narrow
intellectualism would make conscious life but a "barren rehearsal" of
the outer world, without significance; because if we can trust the
indications of our intellect, we ought to be able to trust the
indications of the rest of our nature; and because, thus, the only
possible key and standard of truth and reality are in ourselves&mdash;the
whole self, and "necessities of thought" become necessities of a
reason which means loyally to take account of all the data of the
entire man.</p>

<p>And the same point may be thus stated. We use the word rational in
two quite distinct senses: in the narrow sense, as meaning simply the
intellectual; in the broad sense, as indicating the demands of the
entire man. The true mysticism stands for the broadly rational.</p>

<p>So, too, we speak of the necessary fundamental assumption of the
honesty or sincerity of the world; but this includes two quite
distinct propositions: one, that the world must be thinkable,
conceivable, construable, a logically consistent whole, a sphere for
rational thinking,&mdash;where the test is consistency; the other, that the
world must be worth while, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81"
id="page_81">{81}</a></span> must not mock our highest ideals and
aspirations, must in some true and genuine sense satisfy the whole
man, be a sphere for rational living,&mdash;where the test is worth. All
our arguments go forward upon these two assumptions. Now, a true
mysticism contends that the second principle is as rational as the
first, though it must be freely granted that it is not as easy to
employ it for detailed conclusions, and it is consequently much more
liable to abuse. The true mysticism wishes to be not less, but more,
rational. It knows no shorthand substitute for the hard and steady
thinking of the philosopher, or for the historical experience of the
prophet; it needs and uses both.</p>

<p>In all this, it is plain that the truly mystical is a legitimate
outgrowth of the emphasis of the social consciousness upon recognition
of the entire personality. Phillips Brooks finds just this in the
intellectual life of Jesus. "The great fact concerning it is this," he
says, "that in him the intellect never works alone. You never can
separate its workings from the complete operation of the entire
nature. He never simply knows, but always loves and resolves at the
same time."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_41" id="R_41"
href="#F_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82"
id="page_82">{82}</a></span> 3. <i>The Self-Controlled Recognition of
Emotion.</i>&mdash;Moreover, it probably may be fairly claimed that all of
the mystical recognition of the emotional which is valuable or even
legitimate, is preserved, and far more safely and sanely conceived, in
a strictly personal conception of religion. It may well be doubted, if
it is possible in any other way, both to do justice to feeling in
religion, and at the same time to keep feeling in its proper place. Is
it possible briefly to indicate both the recognition of emotion and
the control of emotion in religion?</p>

<p>The true mysticism recognizes that the supreme joy is "joy in
personal life"&mdash;joy in entering into the revelation of a person; and
it believes with reason that a growing acquaintance with God must have
such heights and depths of meaning as no other personal relation can
have. It is not, therefore, afraid or distrustful of true emotion&mdash;of
joy or peace, of intense longing or of keen satisfaction&mdash;in the
religious life.</p>

<p>But the true mysticism knows at the same time that deep revelation
of a person is made only to the reverent, that the conditions are in
the highest degree ethical, and above all must be recognized to be so
in religion. It <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83"
id="page_83">{83}</a></span> does view, then, with deep distrust an
emotional emphasis in religion that ignores the ethical. It cannot
forget that Christ thought that everything must be tested by its
fruits in life. Paul, too, insisted on applying the test of an active
ministering love to the highly valued emotional experiences of the
Corinthians; and writes to the Galatians that there is but one
infallible proof of the working of the Spirit in them&mdash;a righteous
life: "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance."</p>

<p>And a true mysticism knows that the spirit, reverent of
personality, leads to a self-restraint that does not seek the
emotional experience simply as such on <i>any</i> conditions; but,
knowing the supreme psychological conditions of happiness and
character and influence, it loses itself in an unselfish love and in
absorbing work, and understands that it must simply let the
experiences come. It will have nothing, therefore, to do with strained
emotion, or with the working up of feeling for its own sake. It seeks
health, not merely the signs of health. It prizes, therefore, the joy
that simply proclaims itself as the sign of the normal life and so
positively strengthens and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84"
id="page_84">{84}</a></span> cheers, but it will have nothing of the
strain of emotion which is drain.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that it is exactly this true
psychological attitude concerning the emotional life that Phillips
Brooks believed that he found perfectly reflected in Jesus. "The
sensitiveness of Jesus to pain and joy," he says, "never leads him for
a moment to try to be sad or happy with direct endeavor; nor, is there
any sign that he ever judges the real character of himself or any
other man by the sadness or the happiness that for the moment covers
his life. He simply lives, and joy and sorrow issue from his living,
and cast their brightness and their gloominess back upon his life; but
there is no sorrow and no joy that he ever sought for itself, and he
always kept a self-knowledge underneath the joy or sorrow, undisturbed
by the moment's happiness or unhappiness."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_42" id="R_42" href="#F_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>How far from this objectivity and this healthful emotional life is
the atmosphere of most of our devotional books, and, one might say, of
all the manuals of ordinary mysticism! That this difficulty should
confront us in devotional literature is very natural; for such writing
commonly aims to give the emotional <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> sense of reality in
religion; and is, therefore, particularly under the temptation to show
and to produce a straining after the emotion, as for its own sake.
Moreover, the very introspection, almost inevitably involved in the
reading and writing of devotional books, tends to bring about an
artificial change in the religious experience, and so to introduce
into it the abnormal.</p>

<p>But the social consciousness, so far as it affects religion, not
only tends to draw away from the falsely mystical, and to emphasize
the personal, and so to keep the truly mystical, but it is even more
plain that it must tend to insist upon the ethical in religion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE THOROUGH
ETHICIZING OF RELIGION</i></span></h3>

<h4>I. THE PRESSURE OF THE PROBLEM</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> social consciousness looks to the
thorough ethicizing of religion. If the social consciousness is to be
regarded as historically justified, it must believe that this growing
sense of brotherhood and consequent obligation is simply our response
to the on-working of God's own plan, God's own will expressing itself
in us. The purpose to recognize the will of God, thus necessarily
involves the recognition of human relations, since, as soon as
conscience is strongly stirred in any direction, religion can but
feel, in this demand of conscience, the demand of God, and, therefore,
must bring the convictions of the social consciousness into religion.
Indeed, it may be well believed that Kaftan is right in his insistence
that it is exactly through the practical, that is, in the realm of the
ethical, that knowledge arises from faith.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_43" id="R_43" href="#F_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87"
id="page_87">{87}</a></span> In any case, it is evident that the old
problem of faith and works, of religion and ethics, of the first and
second commandments, meets us here in a way not to be put aside. With
an ethical demand so insistent as that of the social consciousness no
religion can be at peace that is not with equal insistence ethical. We
are bound, then, to show how communion with God, the supreme desire to
find God, necessarily carries with it active love for men. We must
show how we truly commune with God in such active service. The social
consciousness, thus, positively thrusts upon every religious man, who
believes in it, the problem of the thorough ethicizing of religion.
Or, to put the matter in a slightly different way, if the sense of the
value and the sacredness of the person is one of the two greatest
moral convictions of our time, then religion must be clearly seen to
hold this conviction, or lose its connection with what is most real
and vital to us. This is the problem.</p>

<h4>II. THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h4>

<p>All will probably agree that religion is communion with God. We
have seen why the social consciousness cannot accept a falsely <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span>
mystical view of that communion. For similar reasons, it must make
absolutely subordinate all non-ethical and simply mysterious means
which make no appeal to the conscience and to the reason&mdash;the falsely
sacramental. Only the person is truly sacramental. Much else may be of
value, but the touch of personal life is the only absolute essential
in religion. We have seen, also, why the social consciousness tends to
regard religion as a strictly personal relation.</p>

<p>Our problem thus becomes: How does the desire for personal relation
with God, the desire for God himself, lead directly into the ethical
life&mdash;into the full and practical recognition of the ethical demands
of the social consciousness?</p>

<p>To guard against any possible misconception, it is, perhaps, well
to say at the start that the desire for a personal relation with God
has no purpose of returning by another route to the false position of
mysticism, in the claim of special private revelations that are
exclusively for it. It expects, rather, personal conviction of that
great revelation that is common to all, and, moreover, it knows well
that no personal relation is essentially sensuous, and it certainly
looks for no sensuous relation to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89"
id="page_89">{89}</a></span> It may be worth while, too, to reverse
our question for a moment, and ask how morality necessarily involves
religion. The true moral life is the fulfilment of all personal
relations, and as such can least of all omit the greatest and most
fundamental relation which gives being and meaning and value to all
the rest&mdash;the relation to God. The fully moral life, therefore, must
include religion. The unity of the two may be thus seen.</p>

<p>But the present inquiry looks at the matter from the other side,
and seeks a careful and thoroughgoing answer to the question: Why is
the Christian religion, as a personal relation to God, necessarily
ethical?</p>

<h4>III. THE ANSWER</h4>

<p>1. <i>Involved in Relation to Christ.</i>&mdash;In the first place,
then, it probably may be safely claimed that there is no test of the
moral life of a man so certain as his attitude toward Christ. Setting
aside, now, any special religious claims of Christ altogether, and
recognizing him only as earth's highest character, the supreme artist
in living, who knows the secret of the moral life more surely and more
perfectly than any other, he becomes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> even so the surest
touch-stone of character; and the iron filings will not be more
certainly attracted to the magnet than will the men of highest
character be attracted to Christ when he is really seen as he is.
There is no test of character so certain as the test of one's personal
relation to the best persons. The personal attitude toward Christ is
the supreme test. In receiving him, in becoming his disciples in a
completer sense than we own ourselves the disciples of any other, we
make the supreme moral choice of our lives; and, if no more is true
than has been already said, we so accept as a matter of fact the
fullest historical revelation of God at the same time. The ethical and
religious here fall absolutely together. And all the subsequent
choices of our Christian life, if true to Christ, are necessarily
moral.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Divine Will Felt in the Ethical Command.</i>&mdash;In the
second place, the sense of the presence of God, of the divine will
laid upon us, if we have the religious feeling at all, comes to us
nowhere in our common life so certainly and so persistently as in a
sense of obligation which we cannot shake off, a sense of facing a
clear duty. To run away from this, we are made to feel, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> is
plainly to run away from God. Is this not a simply true interpretation
of the common consciousness? Here, then, the religious experience is
in the very sphere of the ethical, and identical with it.</p>

<p>3. <i>Involved in the Nature of God's Gifts.</i>&mdash;Again, God's
gifts in religion are of such a kind that they simply cannot be given
to the unwilling soul; just to receive them, therefore, implies
willingness to use them; and faith becomes inevitably both "a gift and
an activity." However one names God's gifts in religion, so long as
the relation is kept a spiritual one at all, receiving the gift
requires a real ethical attitude in the recipient. A real forgiveness,
for example, involves personal reconciliation, restored personal
relations; and reconciliation is mutual. One cannot, then, be said in
any true sense to accept forgiveness from God who is not himself in an
attitude of reconciliation with God, of harmony of will with him. In
the same way, peace with God, the gift of the Spirit, life, God's own
life, cannot be really given to any man without an ethical response on
his part in a definite attitude of will. Anything arbitrary here is,
therefore, necessarily shut out. God's gifts in religion are <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span> of such
a kind that they simply cannot be given to the unwilling soul. They
are not things to be mechanically poured out on men. We have no need,
consequently, to guard our religious statements in this respect. We
cannot even receive from God the spiritual gifts of the religious
relation without the active will. Here, too, religion is certainly
ethical.</p>

<p>4. <i>Communion with God, through Harmony with His Ethical
Will.</i>&mdash;Or, one may say, desire for real communion with God seeks
God himself, not things, or some experience merely. But the very
center of personality is the will; any genuine seeking of God himself,
therefore, to commune with him, requires unity with his ethical will.
The deepest religious motive is at the same time, thus, an impulse to
character.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Vision of God for the Pure in Heart.</i>&mdash;Christ's own
statement&mdash;"Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see
God"&mdash;suggests another aspect of this essential unity of the religious
and the ethical. The connection in the beatitude is no chance one. The
highest and completest revelation of personality, human or divine, can
be made only to the reverent. God reveals himself <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> to the
reverent soul, and most of all to the pure&mdash;to those souls that are
reverent of personality throughout and under the severest pressure.
Therefore, the pure in heart shall see God. "The secret of the Lord is
with them that fear him."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_44"
id="R_44" href="#F_44">[44]</a></span> The vision of God requires the
spirit that is reverent of personality, and this spirit is the abiding
source of the finest ethical living.</p>

<p>6. <i>Sharing the Life of God.</i>&mdash;But perhaps the clearest and
most satisfactory putting of the relation is this. The very meaning of
religion is sharing the life of God. As soon, now, as God is conceived
as essentially holy and loving, a God of character, a living will and
not a substance&mdash;and Christianity to be true to itself, must always so
conceive him&mdash;so soon religion and morality are indissolubly united.
God's life, according to Christ's teaching, is the life of constant
and perfect self-giving. To share the life of God, therefore, to share
his single purpose, is to come into the life of loving service. The
two fall together from the point of view of the social consciousness.
And we are "saved," we come into the real religious life, only in the
proportion in which we have really learned to <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> love. "Everyone that
loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_45" id="R_45" href="#F_45">[45]</a></span> The old separation
of religion and character is impossible from this point of view.</p>

<p>7. <i>Christ, as Satisfying Our Highest Claims on Life.</i>&mdash;But we
may still profitably press the question: Is the Christian
religion&mdash;the special faith in the revelation of God in Christ, the
best way to righteousness? does it necessarily, most naturally, most
spontaneously, and most joyfully carry righteousness of life with it?
If this is to be true, Christian faith, in Herrmann's language, "must
give men the power to submit with joy to the claims of duty."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_46" id="R_46" href="#F_46">[46]</a></span>
It may be doubted whether any one has dealt with this question as
satisfactorily as Herrmann himself, and a few sentences may well be
quoted from his discussion. "We know that the ordinary instinctive way
in which men seek the satisfaction of all the needs of life makes it
impossible to submit honestly to the demands of duty, and we see,
also, the falsity of the childish idea of the mystics that this
instinct should be extirpated; it follows, then, that we can only seek
moral deliverance in a true and perfect satisfaction <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> of our
craving for life.... Now just such a feeling of perfect inner
contentment is possible to the Christian, and he has it just in
proportion as he understands that God turns to him in Christ.... This
is redemption, that Christ creates within us a living joy, whose
brightness beams even from the eye of sorrow, and tells the world of a
power it cannot comprehend. And the power that works redemption is the
fact that in our world there is a Man whose appearance can at any
moment be to us the mighty Word of God, snatching us out of our
troubles and making us to feel that he desires to have us for his own,
and so setting us free from the world and from our own instinctive
nature."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_47" id="R_47"
href="#F_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ, that is, has no desire to withdraw himself from the test of
the largest life. He is able to satisfy the highest demands for life.
He courts the trial. He claims to offer life, the largest life. "I
came," he says, "that they may have life, and may have it
abundantly."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_48" id="R_48"
href="#F_48">[48]</a></span> His way of deliverance is not negative
but positive, not limiting but fulfilling. He is able to give such
largeness of life in himself, such inner satisfaction of the craving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span>
for life, as makes a lower life lose its power over us, the larger and
higher life driving out the meaner and lower. This is positive
victory, supplanting the lower with the higher; just as in literature,
in music, in friendship, and in love, we expect the best to break down
the taste for the lower.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Vision of the Riches of the Life of Christ, Ethically
Conditioned.</i>&mdash;But the thought of Christ's satisfying our highest
claim on life deserves to be carried further, if it is to be saved
from vagueness and to have its full power with us. The highest value
in the world is a personal life. So Christ has made us feel. It is
finally the only value, for all other so-called values borrow their
value from persons. The highest joy conceivable is entering into the
riches of another's personal life through his willing self-revelation.
Now it is no fine fancy that the supremely rich life of the world's
history is Christ's. God can only be known, if we are not to fall back
into the vagaries of mysticism, in his concrete manifestation; and God
opens out in Christ, the New Testament believes, the inexhaustible
wealth of his own personal life. It is God's highest gift, the gift of
himself. "No one knoweth the Son save the Father; neither <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> doth
any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son willeth to
reveal him."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_49" id="R_49"
href="#F_49">[49]</a></span> "This is life eternal, that they should
know thee, the only true God, and him whom thou didst send."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_50" id="R_50" href="#F_50">[50]</a></span>
So it seemed to Paul: "Unto me, who am less than the least of all
saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the
unsearchable riches of Christ."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_51"
id="R_51" href="#F_51">[51]</a></span> Do we not here catch a glimpse
of what the depth of that satisfaction with the inner life of God in
Christ may be?</p>

<div class="poem">
 <span class="iq">"For He who hath the heart of God sufficed,</span>
 <span class="i0">Can satisfy all hearts,&mdash;yea, thine and mine."</span>
</div>

<p class="nodent">Only the riches of a personal life can satisfy our
claim on life, our desire for life; and, ultimately, we can be fully
satisfied only with God's own life in the fullest revelation he can
make of it to us men. Only this can be "the unspeakable gift." The
thirst for God, for the living God, is a simply true expression of the
human heart when it comes to real self-knowledge.</p>

<p>But the riches of the personal life of Christ are necessarily
hidden to one who does not come into the sharing of Christ's purpose.
The condition of the vision is ethical. The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> very satisfaction,
therefore, of our craving for life constantly impels to a more perfect
union with the will of Christ; for such complete entering into the
life of another with joy implies profound agreement. The desire for
life, therefore, for God's own life, for communion with God, itself
impels to character. Faith does here give "the power to submit with
joy to the claims of duty," and religion is ethical in the very heart
of it.</p>

<p>9. <i>The Moral Law, as a Revelation of the Love of God.</i>&mdash;The
same unity of the religious and ethical life is helpfully seen, if we
put the matter in one further and slightly different way. Only the
Christian religion, faith in God as Father revealed in Christ, enables
us to welcome the stern demands of duty and so gives us inner
deliverance, joy, and liberty in the moral life; for now the moral
demand is seen, not as task only, but as opportunity. For Christ, the
law of God is a revelation of the love of God; it is a gracious
indication&mdash;a secret whispered to us&mdash;of the lines along which we are
to find our largest and richest life; it is not a limitation of life,
but a way to larger life. Not, then, the avoidance, as far as
possible, of the law of God, but the completest fulfilment of it is
the road <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99"
id="page_99">{99}</a></span> to life&mdash;following the hint of the law
into the remotest ramifications, and into the inmost spirit, of the
life.

The other attitude which assumes that the law is a hindrance to life
is a distinct denial of the love of God. It implies that God lays upon
us demands which are not for our good. It refuses to accept as reality
Christ's manifestation of God as Father. Real belief in the love of
God, on the other hand, must take the fearful out of his commands. To
be "freed from the law," now, has quite a different meaning: not the
taking off from us of the moral demand, but the inner deliverance,
that would not have the command removed, but finds life <i>in</i> it,
and obeys it freely and joyfully. Only a thoroughgoing and fundamental
faith in the Fatherhood of God can bring such inner deliverance, even
as we have seen that only such a faith can really ground the social
consciousness. And such a faith only Christ has proved adequate to
bring.</p>

<p>With this light, now, we feel, in every demand of duty, the
presence of God, and in this presence of God the pledge of life, not a
limitation of life. The religious life desires God, and it finds God
never so certainly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100"
id="page_100">{100}</a></span> as in the purpose fully to face duty.
Every one of the relations of life is, thus, turned to with joy by the
religious man, as sure to be a further channel of the revelation of
God. The thirst for God drives to the faithful fulfilment of the human
relation. Religion becomes joyfully ethical.</p>

<p>Nor is there any possibility of abandonment to the will of God
<i>in general</i>, as the mystic seems often to feel. God's will means
particulars all along the way of our life; and there is no communion
with God except in this ethical will in particulars. At no point,
therefore, can the religious life withdraw itself from the daily duty
and maintain its own existence. The constant inevitable condition of
the religious communion is the ethical will. Our providential place is
God's place to find us. Where God has put us, just there he will best
find us. This is further seen in the fact that the true Christian
experience is a constant paradox: God ever satisfying, and yet ever
impelling&mdash;never allowing us to remain where we are, but holding up to
us the always higher ideal beyond; the law is ever, "Of his fulness we
all received, and grace in place of grace."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_52" id="R_52" href="#F_52">[52]</a></span> The deepening <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span>
communion with God is only through a constantly deepening moral
life.</p>

<p>Such a thoroughgoing ethicizing of religion as the social
consciousness demands, we need not hesitate, therefore, to believe is
possible. The truer religion is to its own great aspiration after God,
the more certainly is it ethical.</p>

<p>But the social consciousness, so far as it influences religion, not
only tends to draw away from the falsely mystical, and to emphasize
the personal and the ethical, it also tends to emphasize in religion
the concretely, historically Christian.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
<span class="h90"><i>THE EMPHASIS OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS UPON<br />
THE HISTORICALLY CHRISTIAN IN RELIGION</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fact that the social consciousness
tends to emphasize in religion the concretely historically Christian,
has been so inevitably involved in the preceding discussions, that it
can be treated very briefly.</p>

<h4>I. THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS NEEDS HISTORICAL JUSTIFICATION</h4>

<p>The justification of the social consciousness, we have seen,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_53" id="R_53" href="#F_53">[53]</a></span>
must be preëminently from history. Neither nature nor speculation can
satisfy it. It needs to be able to believe in a living God who is in
living relation to living men. It needs just such a justification as
historical Christianity, and only historical Christianity, can give;
it needs the assurance of an objective divine will in the world,
definitely working in the line of its own ideals. It needs also to be
able to give such <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103"
id="page_103">{103}</a></span> definite content to the thought of God
as shall be able to satisfy its own strong insistence upon the
rational and the ethical as historical.</p>


<h4>II. CHRISTIANITY'S RESPONSE TO THIS NEED</h4>

<p>If religion is to be a reality to the social consciousness, then,
there must be a real revelation of a real God in the real world, in
actual human history, not an imaginary God, nor a dream God, nor a God
of mystic contemplation. This discernment of God in the real world, in
actual history, is the glory even of the Old Testament; and it came,
as we have seen, along the line of the social consciousness. And it is
such a real revelation of the real God that Christianity finds
preëminently in Christ. It can say to the social consciousness: Make
no effort to believe, but simply put yourself in the presence of a
concrete, definite, actual, historical fact, with its perennial
ethical appeal; put yourself in the presence of Christ&mdash;the greatest
and realest of the facts of history,&mdash;and let that fact make its own
legitimate impression, work its own natural work; that fact alone, of
all the facts of history, gives you full and ample warrant for your
own being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104"
id="page_104">{104}</a></span> If this be true, it can hardly be
doubted that, so far as the social consciousness understands itself
and influences religion at all, it will tend to emphasize, not to
underestimate, the concretely, historically Christian.</p>

<p>The natural influence of the social consciousness upon religion,
then, may be said to be fourfold: it tends to draw away from the
falsely mystical; it tends to emphasize the personal in religion, and
so to keep the truly mystical; it tends to emphasize the ethical in
religion; and it needs the concretely, historically Christian.</p>

<h2>THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS<br />
UPON THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
<span class="h90"><i>GENERAL RESULTS</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question of this third division of
our inquiry is this: To what changed points of view, and to what
restatements of doctrine, and so to what better appreciation of
Christian truth, does the social consciousness of our time lead? The
question is raised here, as in the case of the conception of religion,
not as one of exact historical connection, but rather as a question of
sympathetic points of contact. It means simply: With what changes in
theological statements would the social consciousness naturally find
itself most sympathetic?</p>

<p>Certain general results are clear from the start, and might be
anticipated from any one of several points of view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106"
id="page_106">{106}</a></span></p>

<h4>I. THE CONCEPTION OF THEOLOGY IN PERSONAL TERMS</h4>

<p>In the first place, the social consciousness means, we have found,
emphasis on the fully personal&mdash;a fresh awakening to the significance
of the person and of personal relations. Its whole activity is in the
sphere of personal relations. Hence, as in the conception of religion,
so here, so far as the social consciousness affects theology at all,
it will tend everywhere to bring the personal into prominence, and it
certainly will be found in harmony ultimately with the attempt to
conceive theology in terms of personal relations. These are for the
social consciousness the realest of realities; and if theology is to
be real to the social consciousness, then it must make much of the
personal. Theology, thus, it is worth while seeing, is not to be
personal <i>and</i> social, but it will be social&mdash;it will do justice
to the social consciousness&mdash;if it does justice to the fully personal;
for, in the language of another, "man is social, just in so far as he
is personal."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_54" id="R_54"
href="#F_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The foreign and unreal seeming of many of the old forms of
statement, it may well be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107"
id="page_107">{107}</a></span> noted in passing, has its probable
cause just here. They were not shaped in the atmosphere of the social
consciousness. They got at things in a way we should not now think of
using. The method of approach was too merely metaphysical and
individualistic and mystical, and the result seems to us to have but
slight ethical or religious significance. The arguments that now move
us most, in this entire realm of spiritual inquiry, are moral and
social rather than metaphysical and mystical. It is interesting to
see, for example, how such arguments for immortality as that of the
simplicity of the soul's being&mdash;and most of those used by Plato&mdash;and
how such arguments even for the existence of God as those of Samuel
Clarke from time and space, have become for us merely matters of
curious inquiry. We can hardly imagine men having given them real
weight. A similar change seems to be creeping over the laborious
attempts metaphysically to conceive the divinity of Christ. The
question is shifting its position for both radical and conservative to
a new ground&mdash;from the metaphysical and mystical to the moral and
social; though some radicals who regard themselves as in the van of
progress have not yet found it out, and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> so find fault with one
for not continually defining himself in terms of the older
metaphysical formulas and shibboleths. The considerations, in all
these questions and in many others, which really weigh most with us
now, are considerations which belong to the sphere of the personal
spiritual life. Ultimately, no doubt, a metaphysics is involved here
too; but it is a metaphysics whose final reality is spirit, not an
unknown substance&mdash;Locke's "something, I know not what."</p>

<p>The unsatisfactoriness of even so honored a symbol as the Apostles'
Creed, as a permanently adequate statement of Christian faith, must
for similar reasons become increasingly clear in the atmosphere of the
social consciousness. One wonders, as he goes carefully over it, that
so many concrete statements could be made concerning the Christian
religion, which yet are so little ethical. The creed seems almost to
exclude the ethical. It has nothing to say, except by rather distant
implication, of the character of God, of the character of Christ, or
of the character of men. The life of Christ between his birth and his
death are untouched. The considerations that really weigh most with
us&mdash;as they did with the apostles&mdash;in making us Christians, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span>
certainly do not come here to prominent expression. This whole
difference of atmosphere is the striking fact; and were it not that we
instinctively interpret its phrases in accordance with our modern
consciousness, we should feel the difference much more than we do.</p>

<p>What the previous discussion has called the truly mystical&mdash;the
recognition of the whole man, of the entire personality&mdash;is coming in
increasingly to correct both the falsely mystical and the falsely
metaphysical. We are arguing now, in harmony with the social
consciousness, from the standpoint of the broadly rational, not from
that of the narrowly intellectual.</p>

<h4>II. THE FATHERHOOD OF GOD, AS THE DETERMINING PRINCIPLE<br />
IN THEOLOGY</h4>

<p>One might reach essentially the same general results from the
influence of the social consciousness, by seeing that, so far as it
deepens for us the meaning of the personal, it will deepen immediately
our conception of the Fatherhood of God&mdash;the central and dominating
doctrine in all theology&mdash;and so affect all theology. For, with a
change in the conception <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110"
id="page_110">{110}</a></span> of God, no doctrine can go wholly
untouched. Every step into a deeper feeling for the personal&mdash;and the
growth of the modern social consciousness is undoubtedly a long step
in that direction&mdash;deepens necessarily religion and theology. Perhaps
the possible results here can be illustrated in no way better than by
recalling Patterson DuBois' putting of the needed change in the
conception of the proper attitude of a father toward his child. We are
not to say, he writes: "I will conquer that child, no matter what it
may cost him," but we are to say, "I will help that child to conquer
himself, no matter what it may cost me." Now that change in point of
view is a well-nigh perfect illustration of the social consciousness
in a given relation, and it cannot be doubted that it is a true
expression of Christ's thought of the Fatherhood of God; but has it
really dominated through and through our theological statements?
Manifestly, what it means to us that God is Father depends on what we
have come to see in fatherhood. And Principal Fairbairn, in the second
part of his <i>The Place of Christ in Modern Theology</i>, has given
us a good illustration of how much it means for theology to be in
earnest in making the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111"
id="page_111">{111}</a></span> Fatherhood of God the determining
doctrine in theology.</p>

<h4>III. CHRIST'S OWN SOCIAL EMPHASES</h4>

<p>Again, if the general influence of the social consciousness upon
theological doctrine is to be recognized at all, it is evident that a
Christian theology must take full account of Christ's own social
emphases. By loyalty to these, it will expect best to meet the need of
an enlightened social consciousness. It will strive thus&mdash;to use
Professor Peabody's instructive summary of "the social principles of
the teaching of Jesus"&mdash;to be true to "the view from above, the
approach from within, and the movement toward a spiritual end; wisdom,
personality, idealism; a social horizon, a social power, a social aim.
The supreme truth that this is God's world gave to Jesus his spirit of
social optimism; the assurance that man is God's instrument gave to
him his method of social opportunism; the faith that in God's world
God's people are to establish God's kingdom gave him his social
idealism. He looks upon the struggling, chaotic, sinning world with
the eye of an unclouded religious faith, and discerns in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> it
the principle of personality fulfilling the will of God in social
service."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_55" id="R_55"
href="#F_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>And every one of these three great social principles of Jesus has
obvious theological applications, not yet fully made.</p>

<p>The social consciousness, indeed, well illustrates Fairbairn's
admirable statement of how progress is to be expected in theology.
"The longer the history [of Christ]," he says, "lives in the
[Christian] consciousness and penetrates it, the more does the
consciousness become able to interpret the history in its own terms
and according to its own contents. The old pagan mind into which
Christianity first came could not possibly be the best interpreter of
Christianity, and the more the mind is cleansed of the pagan the more
qualified it becomes to interpret the religion. It is, therefore,
reasonable to expect that the later forms of faith should be the truer
and purer."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_56" id="R_56"
href="#F_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the social consciousness itself is a genuine manifestation of
the spirit of Christ at work in the world, and the mind permeated with
this social consciousness is consequently better able to turn back to
the teaching of Jesus and give it proper interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<h4>IV. THE REFLECTION IN THEOLOGY OF THE CHANGES<br />
IN THE CONCEPTION OF RELIGION</h4>

<p>Once more, theology, as an expression of religion, will at once
reflect any change in the conception of religion. The influence of the
social consciousness upon religion, already traced, will, therefore,
inevitably pass over into theology. This means nothing less than a
changed point of view, in the consideration of each doctrine. For
theology must then recognize clearly that it can build on no falsely
mystical conception of communion with God; but, while keeping the
elements in mysticism which are justified by the social consciousness,
it will require of itself throughout a formulation of doctrine in
terms that shall be thoroughly personal, thoroughly ethical, and
indubitably loyal to the concretely historically Christian. Many
traditional statements quite fail to meet so searching a test; but no
lower standard can give a theology that should fully meet the demands
of the social consciousness.</p>

<p>The general results of the influence of the social consciousness
upon theological doctrine, then, may be said to include: The emphasis
upon the fully personal, and so <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> conceiving theology in
terms of personal relation; the deepening of the conception of the
Fatherhood of God, and making this the determining principle in
theology; the application of the social principles of the teaching of
Jesus to theology; the reflection in theology of the natural changes
in the conception of religion wrought by the social consciousness. Now
any one of these general results indicates the certain influence of
the social consciousness upon theology, and any one might be followed
out into helpful suggestions for the restatement of theological
doctrines.</p>

<p>But we shall probably most clearly and definitely answer the
question of our theme, if we ask specifically concerning the several
elements of the social consciousness: How does a deepening sense of
the like-mindedness of men, of the mutual influence of men, of the
value and sacredness of the person, of personal obligation, and of
love, tend to affect our theological point of view and mode of
statement? And our inquiry will follow these separate questions in
separate chapters, except that for the purposes of theological
inference, the last three may be appropriately grouped together.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE INFLUENCE
OF THE DEEPENING SENSE OF THE<br /> LIKE-MINDEDNESS OF MEN UPON
THEOLOGY</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> definitely considering the influence
of the social consciousness upon theological doctrines, our first
question becomes: How does the deepening sense of the like-mindedness
of men affect theology?</p>

<p>Obviously, here, the change will be largely one of mood. We shall
look at our themes with a different feeling, and so speak differently,
modifying our methods of putting things in those slight ways that do
not seem specially significant to one who judges in the mass, but mean
very much to one who feels the finer implications of personal life.
These finer changes no one can hope to follow out in detail. Certain
of these finer changes will naturally find incidental expression in
the course of the more formal treatment.</p>

<p>But our attention must be mainly given to the statement of some of
the most important of the plainer results of the principle in
theology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116"
id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<h4>I. NO PRIME FAVORITES WITH GOD</h4>

<p>In the first place, this conviction of the like-mindedness of men
means that there can be no prime favorites with God.</p>

<p>It can hardly help affecting the thought of election. Election
will, indeed, be thought of as qualified by the character of the
chosen; for even Paul's argument in Romans clearly recognizes this,
and is, in fact, itself a distinct argument against a narrow doctrine
of election, as others have recognized.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_57" id="R_57" href="#F_57">[57]</a></span> But, beyond this,
the conviction of the like-mindedness of men will especially view
election as a choice for service. The divine method of election must
be in harmony with Christ's fundamental principle of his kingdom, and
with the developing social consciousness: "Whosoever shall be first
among you, shall be servant of all."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_58" id="R_58" href="#F_58">[58]</a></span> It is no accident
that this thought of election as choice for preëminent service, which
is indeed soundly biblical, has come into special prominence in these
days of the social consciousness. The same change is passing over our
view of the "elect," as of the "privileged" and "governing" classes.
We <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117"
id="page_117">{117}</a></span> shall not return to the older feeling
of prime favorites of God, and the problem of evil will find herein a
certain alleviation. We shall feel increasingly that each race and
each individual have their calling and have their compensating
advantages; and that, when it comes down to the final test of
opportunity, the differences in opportunity between individuals are
far less than they seem; for to each one is given the possibility of
the largest service any man can render&mdash;the possibility of touching
closely with the very spirit of his life a few other lives. "There are
compensations," as James says, "and no outward changes of condition in
life can keep the nightingale of its eternal meaning from singing in
all sorts of different men's hearts."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_59" id="R_59" href="#F_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h4>II. THE GREAT UNIVERSAL QUALITIES AND INTERESTS,<br />
THE MOST VALUABLE</h4>

<p>Moreover, since equality of need among men,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_60" id="R_60" href="#F_60">[60]</a></span>
implies, as we have seen, a common capacity&mdash;even if in varying
degrees&mdash;of entering into the most fundamental interests of life, this
belief in the essential likeness of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span> men is likely to carry
with it that most wholesome conviction for theology, that the great
universal qualities and interests are the most valuable. Not that
which distinguishes us from one another, but that which we have in
common is most valuable. As Howells tells the boys in his <i>A Boy's
Town</i>, "the first thing you have to learn here below, is that in
essentials you are just like every one else, and that you are
different from others only in what is not so much worth while."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_61" id="R_61" href="#F_61">[61]</a></span>
This consideration is no small help in facing that most difficult
problem for any ideal view of the world&mdash;the problem of evil.</p>

<p>In God's world, we feel that the most common things ought to be the
best. And this growing conviction of the social consciousness comes in
to confirm our faith. The constant and simple insistence of Christ on
receptivity as a fundamental quality in his kingdom is built, in fact,
on an optimistic faith in the value of the common things.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice the varied confirmations of the value
of the common. How often we have to feel that the deepest discussions
come out with only deeper insight <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> into the great common
truths; and, on the other hand, that in stilted philosophizing, what
seems at first sight a great discovery, proves only a perversely
obscure way of putting a common truth.</p>

<p>It is the very mission of genius&mdash;of the poet in the larger sense,
we are coming to feel, to bring out the value of the common. His
distinctive mark is that he has kept a fresh sense for the great
common experiences of life. So Kipling prays:</p>

<div class="poem">
 <span class="iq">"It is enough that through Thy grace</span>
 <span class="i0">I saw naught common on Thy earth.</span>
 <span class="i0">Take not that vision from my ken."</span>
</div>

<p class="nodent">So, the greatest in art, Hegel contends, has a
universal appeal.</p>

<p>It is a wholesome and heartening conviction, I say, to bring into
theology, that the really best things are common, accessible to all,
actually shared in, to an extent beyond that which our superficial
vision seems to show. For, after all, this conviction of the social
consciousness is only bringing home to us, in a new and appreciable
way, Christ's own optimism and his own faith in the love of the
Father. It is only another illustration of Fairbairn's principle of
the Christian consciousness becoming more Christian, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> so
better able to understand and interpret Christ.</p>

<p>And it leads us back by this route of the social consciousness, to
emphasize in life, and in our theological thinking upon the conditions
of entering the kingdom of God, Christ's own insistence upon the two
universally human characteristics found in every child&mdash;susceptibility
and trust, which, voluntarily cherished, become teachableness and
belief in love. If God is Father indeed, and we are intended to come
to our best in association with him, these qualities must be the most
fundamental ones. And they imply no lack of virility, either, for the
highest self-assertion, as Professor Everett pointed out in his
criticism of Nietzsche, is in complete self-surrender to such a will
as God's. "When Jesus said, 'He that loseth his life shall save it,'
he said in effect&mdash;The self-surrender to which I call you is the
truest self-assertion. We find thus in the teachings of Christianity a
summons to strength far greater than that implied by the
self-assertion which is most characteristic of the teachings of
Nietzsche, because it is the assertion of a larger self."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_62" id="R_62"
href="#F_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121"
id="page_121">{121}</a></span> Our outlook becomes well-nigh hopeless,
when we make our tests of admission to the kingdom so much more
exclusive than Christ himself made them.</p>

<h4>III. ESSENTIAL LIKENESS UNDER VERY DIVERSE FORMS</h4>

<p>It is particularly important for theology that this conviction of
the like-mindedness of men has come from a growing power to discern
essential likeness under very diverse forms; for this consideration
bears not only on the problem of natural evil, but also on the problem
of sin and of the progress of Christianity.</p>

<p>We have taken some curiously diverse paths to this understanding of
diverse lives. Travels, history, biography, autobiographical
fragments, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and&mdash;to no small
degree&mdash;fiction, with its stories of out-of-the-way places and
out-of-the-way peoples and of unfamiliar classes,&mdash;all have been
thoroughfares for the social consciousness here.</p>

<p>We are slowly learning to see the likeness under the differences,
and so to transcend the differences even between occidental and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>
oriental. All this means much, not only for our practical missionary
putting of the truth, but also for our final theological statements.
They will inevitably grow simpler, larger, more universally human, and
at the same time more deep and solid.</p>

<p>We are slowly learning, too, to discern a deep inner content of
life under conditions that have no appeal for us, and to see like
ideals and aspirations under very diverse forms of expression. Take,
for example, these three or four sentences&mdash;a small part of that
quoted by Professor James in his essay, <i>On a Certain Blindness in
Human Beings</i>,&mdash;from Stevenson's <i>Lantern-Bearers</i>: "It is
said that a poet has died young in the breast of the most stolid. It
may be contended rather that a (somewhat minor) bard in almost every
case survives, and is the spice of life to his possessor. Justice is
not done to the versatility and the unplumbed childishness of man's
imagination. His life from without may seem but a rude mound of mud;
there will be some golden chamber at the heart of it in which he
dwells delighted."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_63" id="R_63"
href="#F_63">[63]</a></span> And, later, on the side of ideals,
Stevenson is quoted once again: "If I could show you <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span>
these men and women all the world over, in every stage of history,
under every abuse of error, under every circumstance of failure,
without hope, without help, without thanks, still obscurely fighting
the lost fight of virtue, still clinging to some rag of honor, the
poor jewel of their souls!"<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_64"
id="R_64" href="#F_64">[64]</a></span> And now, having quoted Howells
and Stevenson as theological authorities, I shall be pardoned if, for
a moment, I erect Kenneth Grahame's <i>Golden Age</i> into a
"theological institute": "See," said my friend, bearing somewhat on my
shoulder, "how this strange thing, this love of ours, lives and shines
out in the unlikeliest of places! You have been in the fields in early
morning? Barren acres, all! But only stoop&mdash;catch the light
thwartwise&mdash;and all is a silver network of gossamer! So the fairy
filaments of this strange thing underrun and link together the whole
world. Yet it is not the old imperious god of the fatal bow&mdash;<span
title="herôs&nbsp;hanikate&nbsp;machan" >&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#962;
&#7936;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;
&#956;&#8049;&#967;&#945;&#957;</span>&mdash;not that&mdash;nor even the placid
respectable <span title="storgê"
>&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#8053;</span>&mdash;but something still
unnamed, perhaps more mysterious, more divine! Only one must stoop to
see it, old fellow, one must stoop!"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_65" id="R_65" href="#F_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span>
It means very much for the sanity of our outlook on life, and for any
possible theodicy, that we can believe the heart of such a view as
this for which Stevenson and Grahame are here contending. And what is
all this attempt to get away from this "certain blindness in human
beings," of which Professor James speaks, but a growing into one of
the fixed habits of Jesus, what Phillips Brooks calls "his discovery
of interest in people whom the world generally would have found most
uninteresting?" "And this same habit," he adds, "passing over into his
disciples, made the wide and democratic character of the new
faith."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_66" id="R_66"
href="#F_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h4>IV. AS APPLIED TO THE QUESTION OF IMMORTALITY</h4>

<p>It may probably be safely said that this steadily growing
conviction of the social consciousness, of the essential likeness of
all men, which is daily confirmed afresh, and the more confirmed the
more careful the study, is not likely to take kindly to the
idea&mdash;which comes into a part of Dr. McConnell's argument concerning
immortality, in his interesting book, <i>The Evolution of
Immortality</i>&mdash;that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125"
id="page_125">{125}</a></span> living creatures classed as men on
physical grounds are not, therefore, to be so classed on psychical
grounds.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_67" id="R_67"
href="#F_67">[67]</a></span> The considerations and illustrations
brought forward by Dr. McConnell, in connection with this proposition,
I cannot think would seem at all conclusive to either the trained
psychologist or sociologist. It is exactly the like-mindedness of men
which the social consciousness affirms, and it has not come hastily to
its conclusion. It will not quickly surrender that conclusion. There
<i>is</i> an "evolution of immortality," and it has been age-long, but
it is pre-human. The belief in immortality so far as it does not rest
purely on the question of the moral quality of a given human life
(where the hypothesis of "immortability" may properly enough come in)
is grounded upon characteristics&mdash;like that of the possibility of
absolutely indefinite progress<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_68"
id="R_68" href="#F_68">[68]</a></span>&mdash;which in sober scientific
inquiry cannot safely be denied to any man, and must be denied to all
creatures below man. In any case, the new theory of "immortability,"
so far as it is based upon the proposition <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> here considered, has
its battle to fight out with this established conviction of the social
consciousness of the essential like-mindedness of all men.</p>

<p>There are various considerations, not all of them wholly
creditable, which will lead many to turn a willing ear to this new
prophesying; but, though it makes much of evolution, it seems to me to
have the whole trend of the social evolution against it, and to give
the lie to that patient sympathetic insight into the lives of other
classes and peoples, which is one of the finest products of the
ethical evolution of the race. If one is tempted to believe that a
good large share of the human race are really brutes in human
semblance,&mdash;and our selfishness and pride and impatience and unloving
lack of insight and desire to dominate may naturally tempt in this
direction,&mdash;let him read that chapter of Professor James to which
reference has already been made, <i>On a Certain Blindness in Human
Beings</i>, and its pendant, <i>What Makes a Life Significant</i>. It
may help his theology. Let him recall the words of Phillips Brooks
concerning this "strange hopelessness about the world, joined to a
strong hope for themselves, which we see in many good religious <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span>
people." "In their hearts they recognize indubitably that God is
saving them, while the aspect of the world around them seems to show
them that the world is going to perdition. This is a common enough
condition of mind; but I think it may be surely said that it is not a
good, nor can it be a permanent, condition. God has mercifully made us
so that no man can constantly and purely believe in any great
privilege for himself unless he believes in at least the possibility
of the same privilege for other men."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_69" id="R_69" href="#F_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h4>V. CONSEQUENT LARGER SYMPATHY WITH MEN, FAITH IN MEN,<br />
AND HOPE FOR MEN</h4>

<p>This whole conviction of the social consciousness, of the
like-mindedness of men, leads naturally to increased <i>sympathy with
men</i>, and this in turn to still better discernment of moral and
spiritual realities. And this is of prime importance for the
theologian; for sympathetic insight, it must never be forgotten, is
the true route to spiritual verities. So far as our insight into
actual human life becomes truer, so far our theology becomes clearer
and more reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128"
id="page_128">{128}</a></span> This conviction leads also to increased
<i>belief in men</i>, and consequently to increased belief in the
effectiveness of the higher appeals. The temptation to disbelief in
man was one of the underlying temptations of Christ as he looked
forward to his work; but he turned resolutely from it, and refused to
build his kingdom on any lower appeal that implied a lack of faith in
men. Nothing seems to me more wonderful in Christ than his marvelous
faith in man; for, though he has the deepest sense of the sin of men,
there is not the slightest trace of cynicism in his thought or
life.</p>

<p>This recognition of likeness under diversity, too, leads to
increased <i>hope for men</i>, here and hereafter. In James' words:
"It absolutely forbids us to be forward in pronouncing on the
meaninglessness of forms of existence other than our own.... Neither
the whole of truth nor the whole of good is revealed to any single
observer.... No one has insight into all the ideals. No one should
presume to judge them off-hand."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_70"
id="R_70" href="#F_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>This thought helps us to greater hope for men, because, indeed, it
helps us to the discernment of genuine ideals under very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129"
id="page_129">{129}</a></span> forms of life, of the universal sense
of duty and some loyalty to it, though there is great diversity of
judgment as to what is duty.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_71"
id="R_71" href="#F_71">[71]</a></span> But, it is here to be noted,
also, that the thought of the like-mindedness of men brings greater
hope, because it helps to the discernment of likeness, even under
difference in important terms used. We are coming to see that there is
sometimes, at least, a really strong religious faith where men do not
acknowledge the term. Thus, Bradley says: "All of us, I presume, more
or less, are led beyond the region of ordinary facts. Some in one way,
and some in others, we seem to touch and have communion with what is
beyond the visible world. In various manners we find something higher,
which supports and humbles, both chastens and transports us. And," as
a philosopher he adds, "with certain persons, the intellectual effort
to understand the universe is a principal way of thus experiencing the
Deity."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_72" id="R_72"
href="#F_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Even where the term Deity would be entirely abjured, we have seen
with Paulsen,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_73" id="R_73"
href="#F_73">[73]</a></span> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130"
id="page_130">{130}</a></span> that a real faith essentially religious
in character may be clearly manifest. We are even coming to see that
men may seem to themselves to be contending upon opposite sides of so
fundamental a question as that of the personality of God, and yet be
near together as to their own ultimate faith and attitude, and
possibly even as to their real philosophical views of God; but the
same term has come to have such different connotations for the men,
from their different education and experience, that they simply cannot
use it with the same meaning.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest desire to reduce the concrete, ethical,
definitely personal religion of Jesus to the ambiguities of
philosophical dreamers; the world is going to become more and more
consciously and avowedly Christian. But I do not, on the other hand,
as a Christian theologian, wish to shut my eyes to great essential
likenesses in fundamental faiths and ideals and aspirations, because
they are clothed in different garb. The life and teaching of Jesus
have worked and are working in the consciousness of men far beyond the
limits our feeble faith is inclined to prescribe. There is doubtless
much "unconscious Christianity," much "unconscious <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>
following of Christ."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_74" id="R_74"
href="#F_74">[74]</a></span> And we are only following Christ's own
counsel, when we refuse to forbid the man who is working a good work
in his name, though he follows not with us.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_75" id="R_75" href="#F_75">[75]</a></span> Certainly, if we
accept the witness of a man's life against the witness of his lips
when the witness of his lips is right, we ought to accept the witness
of his life against the witness of his lips when the witness of his
lips is wrong.</p>

<p>With reference to all the preceding inferences from the deepening
sense of the like-mindedness of men, it is particularly worthy of
note, that this conviction of the essential likeness of men has come
into existence side by side with the growing conviction of the moral
unripeness of many men, and in spite of that conviction. The careful
study of different social classes is forcing upon both the scientific
sociologist and the practical social worker, the sense of the ethical
immaturity of men. But deeper than this recognition of moral
unripeness, deeper than the vision of the sad defectiveness of moral
and spiritual ideals and standards, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> deeper than the clear
sense of the immense differences among men as to <i>what</i> is duty,
deeper than the differences in even the most important terms used,
lies this great conviction of likeness&mdash;that all men are moral and
spiritual beings, made for relation to one another and to God; that
they have ideals that have a wide outlook implicit in them, and have
some loyalty to these ideals; that they do have a sense of obligation;
that the moral and spiritual life is a reality, a great universal
human fact.</p>

<h4>VI. JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO LIGHT, AND THE MORAL REALITY<br />
OF THE FUTURE LIFE</h4>

<p>It is no accident, now, that accompanying this double social
conviction, there has come into theology a new insistence upon the
principle of judgment of a man according to his light, and
consequently also, what Professor Clarke calls "a tendency toward the
recognition of greater reality and freedom in the other life, and thus
toward the possibility of moral change."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_76" id="R_76" href="#F_76">[76]</a></span> Our conception of
the future life was certain to be modified by the social
consciousness; and it may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133"
id="page_133">{133}</a></span> doubted if any influence of the social
consciousness upon theology can be more clearly traced historically
than this. The motives that have been working in our minds here
include, on the one hand, a wholesome sense of the imperfection of
even the best human lives; a glad discernment, on the other hand, of
the presence of genuine ideals in lives where we had thought there
were none; the certainty that, as Dr. Clarke says, "for at least
one-third of mankind the entire life of conscious and developed
personality is lived in the other world;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_77" id="R_77" href="#F_77">[77]</a></span> an experienced
unwillingness to say, where we cannot see, the precise point at which
the very diverse lives of men under very diverse conditions come to
full moral maturity; and the conviction that a life that is to be
moral at all must be moral everywhere and through all time, and that
where even we can see a little, God can see much more. All these
motives, now, make us refuse, with Christ, to answer the question,
"Are there few that be saved?" And both with increasing hope, and with
that increasing sense of the seriousness and significance of life
which so characterizes the social consciousness, to urge: "Strive to
enter in." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134"
id="page_134">{134}</a></span> The growing sense of the likeness of
men does affect our thought of the future life. The best men, under
the clearest light, have only begun; for the best, there is still much
need of growth. Who has not begun at all? For whom is there no
growth?</p>

<p>Let us make no mistake here. It is no light-hearted indifference to
character, to which the genuine social consciousness leads. No age,
indeed, ever saw so clearly as ours that the most essential conditions
of happiness are in character, or was more certain that sin carries
with it its own inevitable consequences. It is not a less, but a more,
profound sense of the seriousness of the problem of moral character,
that makes us hesitate to dogmatize concerning the future life.</p>

<p>To bring together, now, the conclusions of the chapter: The first
element in the social consciousness&mdash;the deepening sense of the
likeness of men&mdash;seems likely to affect theology, especially by
modifying the thought of election through emphasis upon choice for
service, and through the clear recognition that there are no prime
favorites with God; by strengthening the conviction that the great
common qualities and interests are the most valuable, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span> and
that genuine and largely common ideals may be found under very diverse
forms and conditions; and thus, on the one hand, by opposing the
denial of the psychical likeness of men, as applied to the problem of
immortality, and, on the other hand, by bringing us to larger sympathy
with men, to larger faith in men, and to larger hope for men; and,
finally, by laying new emphasis upon judgment according to light, and
upon the moral reality and freedom of the future life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE INFLUENCE
OF THE DEEPENING SENSE OF THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF MEN UPON
THEOLOGY</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this first element of the social
consciousness, we turn now to the second, and ask, How does the
deepening sense of the mutual influence of men affect theology?</p>

<h4>I. THE REAL UNITY OF THE RACE</h4>

<p>1. First, then, taken with the sense of the likeness of men, it can
hardly be doubted that sociology's strong feeling of the mutual
influence of men deepens for theology the thought of the real, not the
mechanical, unity of the race. The theologian believes, more than he
did, in a race whose unity is preëminently moral, rather than physical
or mystical. The truly scientific position for the theologian seems to
be, to make no mysterious assumptions, where well-known causes are
sufficient to account for the facts; and those causes which the social
consciousness clearly sees to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137"
id="page_137">{137}</a></span> be at work seem, in all probability,
adequate to account for the facts in discussion so far as those facts
are finite at all.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_78" id="R_78"
href="#F_78">[78]</a></span> The theologian knows, then, a true moral
universe, with a unity which is that of the close personal, mutual
relations of like-minded spiritual beings.</p>

<p>The natural goal of such a race, the only one in which they can
truly find themselves, is the kingdom of God. This conception of
Christ is first thoroughly at home with us, when we see that the true
unity of the race is that of personal moral relation. So far as men
turn from that goal, this same racial unity of the inevitable and most
intimate personal relations converts them into something approaching
Ritschl's conception of an opposing "kingdom of sin."</p>

<p>Are we prepared to be thoroughly loyal to just this conception of
the unity of the race throughout our theological thinking; and so to
give up cherished ideas of "common," "transmitted," "inherited," or
"racial" sin or righteousness, of "mystical solidarity," and racial
ideal representation, etc.? It probably may be said with truth that
few, if any, theological systems have been thus <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>
loyal. Indeed, under what seems a mistaken application of the social
consciousness, and particularly under the misleading influence of the
analogy of the organism, men have believed themselves attaining a
deeper theological view, when they have, in fact, turned away from the
sober teaching of the social consciousness.</p>

<p>It may not be in vain for our theology to hear and receive with
patience a sociologist's definition of the "social mind." Upon this
point Professor Giddings says explicitly: "There is no reason to
suppose that society is a great being which is conscious of itself
through some mysterious process of thinking, separate and distinct
from the thinking that goes on in the brains of individual men. At any
rate, there is no possible way yet known to man of proving that there
is any such supreme social consciousness." Nevertheless, he adds: "To
the group of facts that may be described as the simultaneous
like-mental-activity of two or more individuals in communication with
one another, or as a concert of the emotions, thought, and will of two
or more communicating individuals, we give the name, the social mind.
This name, accordingly, should be regarded as <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> meaning just this group
of facts and nothing more. It does not mean that there is any other
consciousness than that of individual minds. It does mean that
individual minds act simultaneously in like ways and continually
influence one another; and that certain mental products result from
such combined mental action which could not result from the thinking
of an individual who had no communication with fellow-beings."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_79" id="R_79"
href="#F_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Just so far, it may well be supposed, and no farther may we go, in
theology, in moral and spiritual inferences from the unity of the
race. We are members one of another for good and for ill, one in the
unity of the inevitable, mutual influence of like-minded persons.</p>

<h4>II. DEEPENING THE SENSE OF SIN</h4>

<p>And this conviction, in the second place, not only deepens our
sense of the real unity of the race, it deepens also the sense of sin.
And we can hardly separate here the influence of the third element of
the social consciousness&mdash;the sense of the value and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span>
sacredness of the person. As against a rather wide-spread and often
expressed contrary feeling, this deepening sense of sin may yet, it is
believed, be truthfully maintained, <i>so far as the social
consciousness is really making itself felt</i>. There are some
disintegrating tendencies here, no doubt, like the tendency under some
applications of evolution and evolutionary philosophy to turn all sin
into a necessary stage in the evolution. But had not Drummond reason
to say: "There is one theological word which has found its way lately
into nearly all the newer and finer literature of our country. It is
not only <i>one</i> of the words of the literary world at present, it
is perhaps <i>the</i> word. Its reality, its certain influence, its
universality, have at last been recognized, and in spite of its
theological name have forced it into a place which nothing but its
felt relation to the wider theology of human life could ever have
earned for a religious word. That word, it need scarcely be said, is
sin."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_80" id="R_80"
href="#F_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrast this modern sense of sin with the almost total lack of it
among even so gifted a people of the ancient world as the Greeks, and
feel the significance of the phenomenon. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span> But it is particularly
to be noted that this sense of sin in literature is largely due to a
keener social conscience. In fact, if the social consciousness is not
a thoroughly fraudulent phenomenon, it could hardly be otherwise; for
the social consciousness, in its very essence, is a sense of what is
due a person; and sin is always ultimately against a person, failure
to be what one ought to be in some personal relation, including
finally all the relations of the kingdom of God. We simply cannot
deepen the sense of the meaning and value of personal relations, and
not deepen, at the same time, the sense of sin. The meaning of the
Golden Rule, and so the sense of sin under it, deepens inevitably with
every step into the meaning of the person. If the one great
commandment is love, then the sin of which men need most of all to be
convicted is lack of love.</p>

<p>The self-tormenting and fanciful sins of some of our devotional
books very likely are less felt. But the very existence of the social
consciousness seems to be proof that there never was so much good,
honest, wholesome sense of real sin as to-day&mdash;such sin as Christ
himself recognizes in his own judgment test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142"
id="page_142">{142}</a></span> It may be that, in temporary absorption
in the human relations, the relation of all this to the All-Father may
seem forgotten; even so, we may well remember Christ's "Ye did it unto
me." But, in fact, we must go much farther and say, The social
consciousness can only be true to itself finally, as it goes on to see
its acts in the light, most of all, of that single, personal relation
which underlies all others. We have already seen that the social
consciousness requires for its own justification its grounding in the
manifest trend of the living will of God. With this felt
identification of the will of God with love for men, men can still
less shake off easily the conviction of sin.</p>

<p>Probably, most religious men argue a diminishing sense of sin,
because they feel that less is made of those consequences of sin which
have been usually connected with the future life. There may be real
danger here from shallow thinking; but here, too, the social
consciousness has only to be true to itself to be saved from any
shallow estimate of the consequences of sin here or hereafter. As the
sin itself is always, finally, in personal relations, so the most
terrible results of sin, in this life and in all lives, are <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span> in
personal relations. What it costs the man himself in cutting him off
from the relations in which all largeness of life consists, what it
costs those who love him, what it costs God,&mdash;this alone is the true
measure of sin. So judged, sin itself is feared as never before.
Surely, Principal Fairbairn is right in saying: "And so even within
Christendom, sin is never so little feared as when hell most dominates
the imagination; it needs to be looked at as it affects God, to be
understood and feared."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_81" id="R_81"
href="#F_81">[81]</a></span> But it is the inevitable result of the
social consciousness to bring us to the deepest conviction of all
these personal relations, and so to the deepest conviction of sin.</p>

<p>Another consideration deserves attention. We have a growing
conviction that our social ideal is personally realized only in
Christ, and we have given unequaled attention to that life and have
such knowledge of it, in its detailed applications, as no preceding
generation has ever had. This simply means that we have both such a
sense of our moral calling, and are face to face with such a living
standard, as must steadily deepen in us a genuine sense of real sin,
in our falling so far short of the spirit of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144"
id="page_144">{144}</a></span> Theology needs, further, to make
unmistakably clear, and to use the fact, that <i>this mutual influence
of men holds for good</i> as well as for evil; that few greater lies
have ever been told, than the insinuation that only evil is
contagious, the good not. And this conviction of the contagion of the
good, of mutual influence for good, concerns theology particularly in
three ways, all of which may be regarded simply as illustrations or
aspects of the one kingdom of God. We are members one of another (1)
in attainment of character, (2) in personal relation to God, and (3)
in confession of faith. And each of these forms of mutual influence
will need careful attention.</p>

<p>In considering separately here attainment of character and relation
to God, it is not meant for a moment to admit that separation of
ethics and religion which has been already denied, but only to single
out for distinct treatment the one most important and fundamental
relation of life&mdash;relation to God. We are certainly never to forget
that the indispensable condition of right relations to God, is that a
man should have been won into willingness to share God's own righteous
purpose concerning men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145"
id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<h4>III. MUTUAL INFLUENCE FOR GOOD IN THE ATTAINMENT OF CHARACTER</h4>

<p>We know no deeper law in the building of character, than that
righteous character comes through that association with the best in
which there is mutual self-giving. The problem of character implies
not only a bare recognition of a man's moral freedom, but a sacred
respect at every point for his personality. If a man is ever to have
character at all, it must be absolutely his own; he must be won freely
into it. In this free winning to character, no association counts for
its most that is not mutual. I become in character most certainly and
rapidly like that man with whom I constantly am, to whose influence I
most fully surrender, and who gives himself most completely to me.</p>

<p>We may analyze the phenomenon psychologically, as, indeed, we have
already done in showing that a true personal relation to Christ
necessarily carries with it a true ethical life. And that which held
true for religion cannot be false for theology, we may be sure. But,
in any case, we always come back finally to the fact, that character
is truly and inevitably contagious in an association in which there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146"
id="page_146">{146}</a></span> mutual surrender. Character is caught,
not taught. The inner strength of another life to which we surrender
is, as Phillips Brooks somewhere says, "directly transmissible." I
suspect that the ultimate psychological principle at work here is that
of the impulsiveness of consciousness. But, whether that be true or
not, the witness to this contagion is wide-spread among students of
men. "The greatest gift the hero leaves his race," one of our great
novelists says, "is to have been a hero." In almost identical
language, a great ethical and philosophical writer adds: "The noblest
workers of our world bequeath us nothing so great as the image of
themselves. Their task, be it ever so glorious, is historical and
transient, the majesty of their spirit is essential and eternal."</p>

<p>But one might still think, here, only of an example. The other
life, however, must be more to me than mere example. For the highest
attainment in character I need the association of some highest one,
who will give himself to me unreservedly. Redemption to real
righteousness of life cannot be without cost to the redeemer. And it
is a psychologist, facing the ultimate problem of will-strengthening,
who urges in words that might seem <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span> almost to look to
Christ: "The prophet has drunk more deeply than any one of the cup of
bitterness; but his countenance is so unshaken, and he speaks such
mighty words of cheer, that his will becomes our will, and our life is
kindled at his own."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_82" id="R_82"
href="#F_82">[82]</a></span> It <i>is</i> the one great certain road
to character&mdash;as it is to appreciation of every value&mdash;to stay in the
presence of the best, in self-surrender to it. No wonder Christ said,
"I am the Way."</p>

<p>1. <i>The Application to the Problem of Redemption.</i>&mdash;It is
hardly possible to ignore this one great known law of
character-making, which the social consciousness so presses upon us,
in any thinking that is for a moment worth while concerning our
redemption by Christ. And whatever our point of view, this
consideration ought to have weight with us. Nay, must we not make it
necessarily the very center of all our thought here? For all the
realities in this problem of redeeming a man from sin to righteousness
are intensely personal, ethical, spiritual. Now, are we to reach a
deeper view of redemption, by turning away from the deepest ethical
fact to the unethical? Do we so ground our view the more securely? Is
there something holier <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148"
id="page_148">{148}</a></span> than the holy ethical will seen
realized in Christ's life and death? For, if it is the will in his
death by which we are sanctified,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_83"
id="R_83" href="#F_83">[83]</a></span> there can be no sharp
separation of the life and death. Must we not rather expect that the
clearest light, on the holiest in God and our personal relation to
him, will be thrown by the holiest we know in life, in our human
personal relations?</p>

<p>Is not the precise method of redemption, then, to no small degree,
cleared for us right here, in this conviction of the social
consciousness of the contagion of the good in a self-surrendering
association&mdash;the only solidarity of which we can be certain? Christ
saves us, in the only certain way we know that any man is ever saved
to better living, through direct contagion of character, through his
immediate influence upon us. The power of the influence of a redeeming
person must depend upon two facts: the richness of the self that is
given, and the depth of the giving. The supremely redeeming power must
be the giving of the richest self, unto the uttermost. God has not yet
done his best for men, until he gives himself in the fullest
manifestation which can be made <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span> through man to men, and
gives to the uttermost, with no drawing back from any cost. Is it not
because, after all, back of all theories and even in spite of
theories, men have seen in the life and death of Christ just this
eternal giving of God himself, that they have been caught up into some
sharing of the same spirit, and so felt working directly and
immediately upon them the supremest redeeming power the world knows?
The cross of Christ has been God's not only <i>saying</i>, "I will
help that child to conquer himself, whatever it costs me," but God
doing it, and perpetually doing it. Not less than that must be the
cost of a man's redemption.</p>

<p>Character is directly transmissible in an association in which
there is mutual self-giving. It is most easily so transmissible, only
at its highest, in its most perfect manifestation, in its completest
self-giving at any cost.</p>

<p>The self-giving on the part of one trying to win another into
character must precede the self-giving of the sinner; for the sinner's
own willingness to yield himself to the influence of the character of
the other must first of all be won. This initial winning of the
coöperative will of the other is the heart of the whole battle. And
here the power <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150"
id="page_150">{150}</a></span> relied on is not only the unconscious
contagion and imitation of character that enlists a man's interest
almost by surprise, but also the mightiest influence men know in
breaking down the resisting will and winning men consciously and with
final abandon&mdash;the influence of a patient, long-suffering, persistent,
self-sacrificing love that cannot give the sinning one up.</p>

<p>Most certainly, then, redemption cannot be without cost to the
redeemer of men&mdash;not only that cost to the hero of the superior
showing of superior character in a superior task, but that other cost,
indissolubly linked indeed with this, of reverently, patiently, to the
bitter end, helping another to conquer himself&mdash;the inevitable
suffering of all redemptive endeavor for those whom one loves. This
involves (1) suffering in contact with sin, (2) suffering in the
rejection by those sinning, and most of all, (3) suffering in the sin
itself of those one loves because one loves them&mdash;suffering which is
the more intense, the more one loves.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Consequent Ethical and Spiritual Meaning of Substitution
and Propitiation.</i>&mdash;Can we go yet a step farther here? It may be
fairly taken for granted that where the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span> church has strongly and
persistently stood for certain modes of putting a doctrine&mdash;though the
precise putting may be unfortunate&mdash;that in all probability there is
there some real and important truth after which the consciousness of
the church is dimly feeling. Starting, now, from this same great law
of the contagion of character and the inevitable influence of an
association in which there is mutual self-giving, is it not possible
to show that there is a strict ethical and spiritual sense that we can
understand, in which Christ's suffering may be truly called vicarious,
and himself a substitute for us, and a propitiation?</p>

<p>It is, of course, not for a moment forgotten that, in Dr. Clarke's
language, "a God who will himself provide a propitiation has no need
of one in the sense which the word has ordinarily borne. Some richer
and nobler meaning must be present if the word is appropriate to the
case."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_84" id="R_84"
href="#F_84">[84]</a></span> But it is not likely that a purely
ethical and spiritual view of the atonement, which sees the problem as
a strictly personal one&mdash;and this seems to the writer the only true
position&mdash;can ever succeed in the hearts of the great body of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152"
id="page_152">{152}</a></span> membership of the churches, if it
cannot show, at the same time, that it is able in some real way to
take up into itself these thoughts of substitution and propitiation.
The writer finds much of the old language about the atonement as
offensive to his moral sense as any man well can. But that there is an
absolutely universal human need for something like that to which the
old language of substitution and propitiation looked, he cannot doubt.
It seems to show itself in this, that no man with real moral sense,
probably, cares to put himself at the end of his life, say, in the
attitude of the Pharisee rather than in that of the Publican. If one
sets aside all spectacular elements in the judgment, and even denies
altogether any great single final assize for all men, still he cannot
avoid the thought of some judgment upon his life. As Dr. Clarke says
again: "We are not our own masters in going out of this world; we go
we know not whither. Yet our going is not without its just and holy
method. Our place and lot in the life that is beyond must be
determined righteously, in accordance with the life that we have lived
thus far, that the next stage in our existence may be what it ought to
be."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_85" id="R_85"
href="#F_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153"
id="page_153">{153}</a></span> However, now, that judgment of God may
be expressed, no man can hope to face the test proposed by Christ in
the twenty-fifth of Matthew, still less the test implied in Christ's
own life, and feel that he has <i>already</i> attained. He knows
himself to be at best only a faulty growing child, with some real
spirit of obedience in his heart. And it is particularly to be noted,
that exactly that man must stand most definitely for the reality of
some genuinely ethical judgment, who has most insisted upon the
necessarily ethical character of the religious life. Moreover, the
normal experience of the deepening Christian life is an increasing
sense of sin. Upon this point, too, the social consciousness is
witness.</p>

<p>What, now, makes it possible for a man to expect, in any sense, a
favorable judgment of God upon his life? If God makes any separation
of men in the world to come, he certainly cannot divide them into
perfect and imperfect men. Judged by any complete standard, all are
imperfect. Or if, without separation, God in any sense, in the most
inner way, passes judgment, how does approval fall upon any? And upon
whom does it fall? Must not every man who wishes to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span> be
clear and honest with himself fairly face these questions?</p>

<p>And Christ's own thought of God as Father must be our key here. And
the matter may well be counted worth a more careful analysis than it
often gets. How does a father distinguish between what he calls an
obedient and a disobedient child? Both are faulty. How in any fair
sense may one be called obedient? To the earthly father, that child is
called an obedient child, not who is deliberately setting his will
against his father's with no intention to coöperate with the father's
purpose for him, but whose loyal intention is to do the father's will,
really to coöperate with the father in the father's own purpose for
the child's life. When, now, this child is carried away by some gust
of temptation and disobeys, and then returns in penitence to the
father, evidently viewing the sin, so far as his experience allows, as
the father views it, and heartily putting it away, the father,
<i>either with or without penalty</i>, restores the child to full
personal relation to himself; and that is the vital point. And, though
he neither judges the past life as without failure, nor expects the
future to be without failure, he approves the child, as in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> a
true sense obedient. He is an approved child.</p>

<p>What is it that satisfies the father in such a case? Upon what does
he rely in his hope for matured character in the child? What, in
biblical language, "covers" for the father the actual disobediences of
the past and the certain disobediences of the future, and enables him
in a sense to ignore both in his approval of the child? Certainly, the
present purpose of the child, the child's honest intention to
coöperate with the father in the father's purpose for him. Yes; but as
certainly, it seems to the writer, <i>not that alone</i>. The father's
hope for his child's steady growth in righteousness depends not only
on the child's present intention, but much more upon the father's own
intention never to give up in his attempt at any cost to help that
child to conquer himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_86"
id="R_86" href="#F_86">[86]</a></span> The father may be said here in
a true sense to propitiate himself; and his own fixed purpose has
become a partial substitute for the wavering purpose of the child.</p>

<p>And the child's full righteousness is seen, not merely in an
attitude of immediate present obedience, but especially in his loyal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156"
id="page_156">{156}</a></span> acceptance of his filial relation&mdash;in
his honest surrender to his father's influence. And the father can now
say, Because my child accepts heartily his relation to me, and
honestly throws himself open to it to let it be to him all it can and
work its own work in him, I may approve him; for this relation to me
which he so takes has only to go on, to work out its complete results
in a matured character. In the hearty acceptance of this filial
relation to me, there is contained the promise of the end.</p>

<p>Just this attitude exactly, and no other, it seems to the writer,
God takes toward men in his revelation in Christ. Christ is God's own
showing forth of himself. "God was in Christ reconciling the world
unto himself."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_87" id="R_87"
href="#F_87">[87]</a></span> "Propitiation," Beysclag truly says, "is
blotting out, making amends for sin in God's eyes. Now what can cover
the sin of the world in God's eyes? Only a personality and a deed
which contain the power of actually delivering the world from its
sin."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_88" id="R_88"
href="#F_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen, it may be hoped, just how God's self-revealing in
Christ does have this actual power, and becomes, thus, a true
propitiation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157"
id="page_157">{157}</a></span> in the highest moral sense, in the only
sense in which God can wish a propitiation, and in the only sense in
which we can ever need a propitiation. Our final hope for that true
salvation, which is the sharing of the life of God and the involved
likeness of character with God, is in God's own long-suffering,
redeeming activity. Only as <i>that</i> may be remembered, in
connection with our surrender to it, may we hope to stand approved
before the judgment of God. We are not judged alone before the
judgment of God. In a very real sense the judge himself stands with
us. Not what God is able to believe about this man thought of as
standing alone, but what he may believe about this man standing in a
living, surrendering association with himself, is the ground of
judgment. We may not separate here the work of God and the work of
Christ, as the New Testament does not separate them. In constant
reliance upon the constant redeeming activity of the Father here and
hereafter, we children go hopefully on our way.</p>

<p>Put into the language of the blood covenant, where the blood has
all its significance as life&mdash;the giving of life, the sharing of life,
the closest and most indissoluble union of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> lives&mdash;this is to say,
there is no atonement, no reconciliation, no remission of sins, no
forgiveness&mdash;and these are all essentially identical terms&mdash;without
shedding of blood, that is, without complete giving of life on both
sides, Christ giving himself not only <i>for</i> us in seeking us out,
but <i>to</i> us in complete reconciliation and renewal of life. It
means that only God, the very life of God, sharing God's life, can
really save one from his sins. God must pour his life into one, and he
does, in Christ.</p>

<p>This seems to be the heart of the whole matter; but certain
considerations may be still added, as indicating how far a purely
ethical and spiritual view of the atonement may go, in meeting the
human need expressed in these older terms of substitution and
propitiation.</p>

<p>There must be a wrath of God against wilful sin, a complete
disapproval of it, and all the more because God loves the sinner. God
is a consuming fire for sin in us, because he loves us. That wrath
cannot be propitiated, that disapproval cannot be satisfied, in any
effective way, so long as the sin continues. The punishment of the sin
in its inevitable consequences, will go on in the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> very
fidelity of God. But for any real satisfaction of God, the sin itself
must cease, and there must be assurance of righteousness to come. The
sinner must come to share God's hatred of the sin and God's positive
purpose of love. Hence the expiation of the sin, the propitiation of
the wrath of God, the satisfaction of God&mdash;so far as these terms still
have meaning, and so far as they express Christ's work&mdash;consist (1) in
winning men to repentance, to sharing God's hatred of their sin, (2)
in helping men to a real power against sin, and (3) in the assurance
of perfecting righteousness which is contained in the relation to God
honestly accepted by men. When, now, the unfilial spirit is thus
changed into a completely filial spirit&mdash;through the fullest
acceptance by the child of the father's purpose for him, and through
the child's throwing himself completely open to the influence of the
father&mdash;the personal relation <i>is</i> thereby inevitably changed,
personal reconciliation is achieved. It is impossible to think it
otherwise. And so the chief pain in the previous relation is done away
both for God and man; though the punishment, in the consequences of
sin in other respects, is not thereby set aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160"
id="page_160">{160}</a></span> But, further, so far now as the power
of this new personal relation to God in Christ begins actively to
counteract the consequences of sin in us, as it will assuredly do,
God's work in Christ becomes a direct substitute for that punishment
of us that would else inevitably follow. And yet the process is wholly
ethical; for the results of righteousness can actually occur in us,
only in so far as we come into harmony with Christ's purpose for
us.</p>

<p>Even so far, we may believe, does the social consciousness, in its
emphasis upon the mutual influence of persons go, in leading us into
the secret of the attainment of character&mdash;into the heart of God's
redemption of men.</p>

<h4>IV. MUTUAL INFLUENCE FOR GOOD IN OUR PERSONAL RELATION<br />
TO GOD</h4>

<p>What, now, in the second place, does the mutual influence of men
for good mean for theology in the individual relation to God? Here it
may be said at once, that faith is as directly contagious as
character.</p>

<p>1. <i>In Coming into the Kingdom.</i>&mdash;We are introduced through
others into all spheres of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161"
id="page_161">{161}</a></span> value, including friendship even with
God. In the atmosphere of those who already feel the value, our
interest is aroused; we find it possible at least to take those
initial steps of a dawning attention, which give the value opportunity
to make its own impression upon us, and bring us to an appreciation,
to a faith of our own. Only so is that most difficult of all tasks in
the redemption of a man&mdash;that first stirring of a new appetite, a new
desire, a new aspiration, a new ideal&mdash;accomplished.</p>

<p>We are members one of another here to an extent that deserves ever
fresh emphasis. We cannot too often say to ourselves, Had it not been
that there were those who actually entered into the meaning of the
revelation of God in Christ&mdash;who, in John's language, "beheld his
glory"&mdash;the record of that revelation never could have come down to
us. Christianity must have perished at its birth. "Hence," in the
vital language of Herrmann, "the picture of his inner life could be
preserved in his church or 'fellowship' alone. But, further, this
picture so preserved can be understood only when we meet with men on
whom it has wrought its effect. We need communion with Christians in
order that, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162"
id="page_162">{162}</a></span> from the picture of Jesus which his
Brotherhood has preserved, there may shine forth that inner life which
is the real heart of it. It is only when we see its effects, that our
eyes are opened to its reality so that we may thereby experience the
same effect. Thus we never apprehend the most important element in the
historical appearance of Jesus until his people make us feel it. The
testimony of the New Testament concerning Jesus is the work of his
church, and its exposition is the work of the church, through the life
which that church develops and gains for itself out of this treasure
which it possesses."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_89" id="R_89"
href="#F_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Christian is no Melchizedek, then, without father or mother; he
comes into life in a community of life, and usually, moreover, through
the personal touch of some other individual life. It is the one primal
law, of life through life.</p>

<p>2. <i>In Fellowship within the Kingdom.</i>&mdash;And not only in coming
into the kingdom, but also within the religious fellowship of the
kingdom, we are emphatically members one of another. In bringing us
into that love which is God's own life, God evidently has <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> no
intention of allowing us to cut ourselves off from our brethren, to
climb up to heaven by some little individual ladder of our own. That
humility or open-mindedness, which constitutes the first beatitude and
the initial step into the kingdom, and that self-sacrificing love,
which constitutes the last beatitude and the crown of the Christian
life, are both possible and cultivable only in personal relations to
others. No man ever got them alone. And, for this very reason, in the
discussion of the religious life, we found the New Testament guarding
most carefully against all over-estimation of marvelous experiences as
such. For these tended to make a man feel that he had such an
individual ladder of his own to heaven, and had no need, consequently,
of his brethren; and so led him into the very reverse of the
fundamental Christian qualities&mdash;into unteachableness instead of
humility and open-mindedness, and into censoriousness instead of love.
That objective attitude which is essential in all character and work
and happiness, cannot be unimportant in our specifically religious
life.</p>

<p>Even in this most individual relation to God, then, men's outlook
is varied and but partial. We need to share, and can share, one <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span>
another's visions. The meaning of the many-sidedness of even a great
human personality gets home to us only so&mdash;through the various
impressions gained by different men. Much more can God be revealed to
us, even approximately, only so. The great and surpassing value of the
New Testament lies exactly herein, that it gives the varied
impressions upon the first Christian generation of God's supreme
revelation&mdash;the most important individual reflections of Christ. The
New Testament comes to stand, thus, in no merely external and
mechanically authoritative relation to the life and faith of the
church, but in the most interior and vital relation. And Bible study
gets a new significance for us, as we see it, as at one and the same
time our chief way to our own vision of God's actual, concrete
self-revelation, and our deliverance from our merely subjective
dreaming. We come to share in some living way the vision of these
others who have seen most directly and most largely.</p>

<p>3. <i>In Intercessory Prayer.</i>&mdash;One particular application to
our religious life, of this conviction of the social consciousness of
our mutual influence, seems worthy of mention&mdash;its bearing upon
intercessory prayer. Few <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165"
id="page_165">{165}</a></span> other things in religion, one may
suspect, seem less real to modern men. Can we ground the matter a
little more deeply for ourselves, and give it reality, by showing its
close connection with this deep-rooted conviction of the social
consciousness?</p>

<p>We have already seen,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_90"
id="R_90" href="#F_90">[90]</a></span> if character and love are to be
realities to us, if the world is to be a real training-ground for
moral character, and not a mere play-world&mdash;a nursery continually set
to rights from without, that we must all be most closely knit
together; that our choices must have effects in the lives of others;
that we must be bound up in one bundle of life. And we do affect one
another's lives in a thousand ways. In manifold directions we
condition the happiness and temptations of one another. The unspoken
mood of another, an expression of countenance, a tone, an emphasis,
may affect our whole day.</p>

<p>Now, if the spiritual world is real at all, it is to be counted
upon. Apparently, there is such a thing, for example, as a spiritual
atmosphere in an audience&mdash;not, it may well be supposed, a magical
matter, but really determined by the tone of the minds composing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> the
audience. The actual mood of the hearers and of the speaker makes a
difference. Results, great and important, are so changed often quite
unconsciously. It may well be that God is the medium in all this. The
attitude of the auditors is like unconscious, silent praying to
God&mdash;the praying of their life, of their spirit.</p>

<p>But, whether one cares to look at this special case in such a way
or not, we are, in any event, in our spiritual lives in the deepest
way members one of another. Our spiritual condition inevitably affects
others. We cannot sow to the flesh and reap life anywhere, in
ourselves or in others. This is particularly true, of course, of those
to whom we are bound in the closest life relations. That this is
absolutely true in normal personal relations, when we are in the
presence of our friends, all of us fully believe. The question simply
is, May this law of mutual influence hold of those bound up with our
lives even when they are distant from us or estranged? In giving the
privilege of intercessory prayer, it may well be believed, God simply
allows us to be, even then, what we are always so fully under other
circumstances&mdash;an influence upon them, a condition of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span> the
good and growth of others. <i>He simply allows the regular law of the
spiritual and moral world to hold without exception.</i> We are still,
though distant or estranged, members one of another. It would be a
very human, defective, faulty God, who could not put us thus in touch
with our loved ones everywhere. But this is possible through
<i>him</i>, and therefore in prayer, and under strictly ethical and
spiritual conditions, and not as a matter of mere whimsical and wilful
will on our part, and it opens no door to magical superstition. Is not
the recognition of the place and value of intercessory prayer, then,
an only just extension of the prime conviction of the social
consciousness?</p>

<h4>V. MUTUAL INFLUENCE FOR GOOD IN CONFESSIONS OF FAITH</h4>

<p>Theology has, once more, in the third place, to recognize the
importance of mutual influence for good in confession of faith, in
creeds. When, to-day, we seek the common grounds of belief for
Christian thinkers, so far as the social consciousness really moves
us, we approach the problem in a way somewhat different from that of
previous generations. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168"
id="page_168">{168}</a></span> We do not now seek to elaborate a
second, modern Westminster confession; nor do we seek a mere average
of Christian ideas that in reality expresses no one's whole living
thought. Still less is there sought the barest minimum of Christian
belief. Rather, in harmony with the social consciousness, we seek a
unity that is organic. Our age, therefore, must recognize that, in the
confession of its faith as in all else, we are genuinely members one
of another. The unity sought not only tolerates differences, but
welcomes and justifies them, as themselves helps to a deeper unity. It
believes in equality, but not in identity.</p>

<p>It is true that Christianity looks everywhere to life; and we may
be sure that any statement of Christian doctrine that does not
obviously bear on living is still inadequate and incorrect. It is true
that we do well to emphasize the strictly religious and practical
purpose of the Bible; that the Bible is interested in both nature and
history so far and only so far as either reveals God and inspires to
godly living. It is true that in all Christian thinking Christ is our
ultimate appeal.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, we must not confuse the issue. We cannot
expect agreement <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169"
id="page_169">{169}</a></span> in detailed intellectual statements
even with fullest loyalty to Christ, and the most earnest desire after
truth. To each his own message. Nor can we confine, nor is it
desirable to confine, expressions of Christian faith to the merely
practical side. We need to seek to <i>understand</i> the meaning of
our Christian experience, not only for the sake of our intellectual
peace, but also for the sake of deepening our Christian experience
itself. Now, it is here contended that in our confessions of Christian
faith we need one another, and that complete uniformity of belief and
statement is both impossible and undesirable.</p>

<p>1. <i>Complete Uniformity of Belief and Statement
Impossible.</i>&mdash;It is impossible, for, in the first place, it is
difficult, in any case, to tell our real inner creed. Some of its most
important articles are quite certain to be implicit and unconfessed,
even to ourselves. The only important creed, in the case of the
individual, is that which finds its expression in life. There are
assumptions implied in deeds and spirit; and the spirit of a man
throws more light on his real creed than his formal statements do. His
doctrines may be radical, his spirit thoroughly constructive, or
<i>vice versa</i>. If all thought tends to pass into act, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> as
modern psychology insists, we have a right to urge that those articles
of a man's creed which find expression in living, are for him the
really important articles. The will has a creed, as well as the
intellect, and the real creed is the creed of life rather than of
lips; it is wrought out, rather than thought out. And this real,
inner, living creed probably no man can state with accuracy even in
his own case. And if he is ever able even approximately to do so, it
will be at the end, rather than at the beginning, of his life's work
and experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, complete uniformity of belief and statement is
impossible, for, even exactly the same words cannot mean the same to
different individuals, for they are interpreted out of a different
experience; they cannot mean precisely the same thing, even to the
same individual, at different times, for his interpreting experience,
too, is a changing thing. We need sometimes to remind ourselves that
there is never any literal transfer of thought from mind to mind,
still less from statement to mind; all thinking of even the most
passive kind has an element of creation in it, for terms must be
interpreted, and the interpretation is inevitably limited by previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171"
id="page_171">{171}</a></span> experience. Sabatier<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_91" id="R_91" href="#F_91">[91]</a></span>
is quite right, therefore, in asserting that credal statements must
change their meaning just as words change. But it is to be noted that
this principle means not only that unalterable doctrine, in this
sense, is impossible between the generations; but also that identical
doctrine is impossible in the same generation.</p>

<p>Out of the different experiences, too, grow the different points of
view and the different emphases. And these different points of view,
and the different distribution of emphasis, give the same creed very
different meanings for different men. It is as impossible to avoid
this, as it is to avoid change and individuality. It is true of a
man's creed as of his environment, that the only effective portions
are those to which he attends&mdash;those which he emphasizes, not those to
which he gives a bare assent; and this varying attention and emphasis
cannot be the same in different individuals. The only logical outcome
of a thorough-going attempt to reach an identical creed is the church
of one member.</p>

<p>2. <i>Complete Uniformity of Belief and Statement
Undesirable.</i>&mdash;But complete uniformity of belief and statement is
not only impossible; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172"
id="page_172">{172}</a></span> it is undesirable. For, in the first
place, it is only by these differing but supplementary finite
expressions that we can approximate to the infinite truth. Like
Leibnitz's mirrors in the market-place, it is only by combining the
points of view of all that a complete representation is possible. We
need one another here, as elsewhere; we need the fellowship of the
church, and of the whole church; the strictly individual view must be
fragmentary. Our message needs the supplement of the messages of
others; through each member God has something unique to say. They
without us, we without them, are not to be made perfect. We need to
share, in such measure as is possible, the experiences of others; but
this is possible only through vital contact.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are not to forget how truth comes&mdash;not by surrender of
convictions, not by the silence of each, but by each standing
earnestly for the truth which is given to him, in a union of
conviction and charity. For only he who has convictions can be
tolerant, as only he who has fears can be courageous.</p>

<p>Once more, we cannot and must not simply repeat each other. Nothing
is so fatal to spiritual life as dishonesty. To attempt an <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span>
identical creed involves something of such untrue repetition of the
experience of others. For, as Herrmann has said, doctrines are an
expression of life <i>already present</i>, and are of value only so;
they are not themselves a condition of life. If the doctrines we
profess are not the honest expression of a real life in us, they are a
hindrance, not a help. "Conscious untruth tends to drive from
Christ."</p>

<p>For every one of these reasons, now, it is positively undesirable
to forbid varying theories or to check the varied expressions of
Christian faith, whether in accordance or not with certain standard
formulas. A growing life requires a growing expression, which must be
justified by its history, not dogmatically by reference to some
supposed fixed standard of doctrine in the past. The very meaning and
health of Christian fellowship demand that we should welcome and
encourage the honest expression of the varied manifestations of the
One Spirit, that we may be the more certain to get the whole truth,
the whole life which God intends. We are members one of another, in
doctrine as in life.</p>

<p>It becomes increasingly clear, thus, where the real Christian unity
is, and where the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174"
id="page_174">{174}</a></span> common grounds of Christian belief must
be sought. The real unity of Christians is in their common life, in
the common experience, in the possession of the common personal
self-revelation of God in Christ, in the inworking of the One Spirit.
It is the meaning of this one central Christian experience, which we
strive to express in our doctrinal statements. Our <i>expressions</i>
must vary; the life, the personal relation to God, is one. The best
analogy we have of the case lies in what the same great friend means
to different persons. Our creeds are at best poor and partial
expressions of the meaning for us of the divine friendship, of God's
self-revelation to us. It is, then, precisely in our Christian
experience and in that personal relation to God revealed in Christ
which makes a man a Christian at all, that all the common grounds of
Christian belief lie.</p>

<p>The solution of Christian unity here, that is, is not by increasing
abstraction, but by frank concreteness; not by false simplicity, but
by living fullness; not by relation to propositions, but by relation
to facts; not by emphasis on natural religion, but by emphasis on
historical religion; not by bringing nature into prominence, but human
nature; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175"
id="page_175">{175}</a></span> not by relation to things, but by
relation to persons, to the one great world fact, the one person, to
Christ. "I am the Way." The Christian faith is faith in a person; the
Christian confession of faith is confession of Christ. And if we are
really in earnest with this word Christian, we already have our basis
of unity in our personal relation to Christ, our common Lord. But that
personal relation to God in Christ is always more than a credal
statement <i>can</i> express, though we may never cease to attempt
such expression; and for the sake of the larger realization, by
ourselves and by the church, of the meaning of the personal relation
to Christ, we must welcome every honest expression of his Christian
life by another. Altogether, we shall at best but dimly shadow forth
its full meaning.</p>

<p>And such a concrete relation to the personal Christ is a far better
test of genuine Christian faith than any creed, whether more or less
elaborate, since in the personal relation character inevitably comes
out; and any test that allows even for the moment the ignoring of the
ethical, cannot remain even intellectually adequate, for Christian
doctrine looks always and certainly to life. Even if one is thinking
<i>only</i> of the correct intellectual <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span> expression of the
common Christian life&mdash;the maintenance of orthodoxy, so far as that is
possible to us&mdash;it should be remembered that the most conservative of
all influences is love of a person, and, by no means, subscription to
a set of propositions. Would Christ so think? Would he so
speak?&mdash;these are questions far more certain to keep Christian
<i>thinking</i> true, than any intellectual test of man's
devising.</p>

<p>We do not expect, therefore, we do not seek, any common grounds of
belief for Christian thinkers, other than are involved in the simple
fact that we are Christians at all, in the common recognition of the
revelation of God in Christ&mdash;of the Lordship of Christ. We confess
Christ. For, "no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit."
And "other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which
is Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Now, in this common confession, it is here especially maintained,
we are, as everywhere, "members one of another" and need one another;
and the unity we seek, therefore, is not the unity of identical credal
statement&mdash;which can only make us isolated atoms not necessary to one
another&mdash;but the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177"
id="page_177">{177}</a></span> deeper and larger organic unity of the
richly varying manifestations of the common life in Christ. We may
come, through the witness of another, to an appreciation of Christ
which is really our own, but to which we should not have come if the
other had not spoken. Men do mutually influence one another for good,
in their confessions of Christian faith.</p>

<h4>VI. THE CONSEQUENT IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCTRINE<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h4>

<p>In this recognition of the vital and essential importance of mutual
influence in the attainment of character, in the individual relation
to God, and in creed, theology is brought to a new sense of the
significance of the doctrine of the church. On the one hand, it cannot
derive its importance from having to do with an unalterably fixed and
infallibly organized external authority; and, on the other hand, it
can be no longer an unimportant addendum concerned only with methods
of organization and government, and with ecclesiastical ordinances and
procedure. So far as the social consciousness has influence upon
theology at this point, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178"
id="page_178">{178}</a></span> theology must see that the doctrine of
the church is the doctrine of that priceless, living, personal
fellowship, in which alone Christian character, Christian faith, and
Christian confession can arise and can continue. The doctrine of the
church becomes thus the doctrine of the very life and growth of
Christianity in the world. It is the doctrine of the real kingdom of
God, Christ's own great central theme.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br /><br /> <span class="h90"><i>THE INFLUENCE
OF THE DEEPENING SENSE OF THE<br /> VALUE AND SACREDNESS OF THE
PERSON<br />UPON THEOLOGY</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the discussion of the influence of
the social consciousness upon theological doctrine, we turn now to ask
concerning the third element of the social consciousness, How does the
deepening sense of the value and sacredness of the person affect
theology?</p>

<p>And with this sense of the value and sacredness of the person, we
may well include, so far as the influence upon theology is concerned,
the remaining elements of the social consciousness&mdash;the deepening
sense of obligation, and of love. For, as we have already seen, the
sense of obligation and of love follow so inevitably from a deep sense
of the value and sacredness of the person, that it would be a needless
refinement, probably, to try to analyze out their separate influence
upon theological thinking. We should find them all leading us to
essentially the same great emphases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180"
id="page_180">{180}</a></span> When, now, through the social
consciousness, the personal has become the supreme value for us, and
regard for it our eternal motive and goal, we cannot fail to demand
that theology give a real personality to God and man&mdash;a consciousness
marked, in Professor Howison's language, with "that recognition and
reverence of the personal initiative of other minds which is at once
the sign and the test of the true person."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_92" id="R_92" href="#F_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h4>I. THE RECOGNITION OF THE PERSONAL IN MAN</h4>

<p>In the first place, the social sense of the value and sacredness of
the person will emphasize the full personality of man.</p>

<p>1. <i>Man's Personal Separateness from God.</i>&mdash;The sense of the
value of the person cannot admit for a moment such a one-sided
emphasis upon a universal cosmic evolution, or upon the immanence of
God, as should make impossible a true personality in man. It seeks, in
its view of both God and man, a really "<i>personal</i> idealism." It
does not forget, but earnestly asserts, the dependence of all other
spirits upon God; and, consequently, looks for no metaphysical
separateness in this sense <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181"
id="page_181">{181}</a></span> from God. But a genuine recognition of
the personality of man does require that man be conceived as separate
from God in just this sense: (1) that he has a clear
self-consciousness of his own, and (2) that he has real moral
initiative, which makes his volition truly his own. These two factors
constitute all of separateness that need be demanded for man.
Possessing these, he is "outside of God" in the only sense in which a
"personal idealism" feels concerned to assert separateness. But for
these factors it is concerned; for without them, it believes, no truly
ideal view, no moral world, no religious life, are possible.</p>

<p>2. <i>Emphasis Upon Man's Moral Initiative.</i>&mdash;In particular, the
application of the sense of the value and sacredness of the person in
theology, means the emphatic recognition of the moral initiative of
man&mdash;of the possession of a real will of his own. The whole social
consciousness, especially in this third element of it, rests upon the
assumption that man has worth, as a being capable of character as well
as of happiness, and so deserves in some worthy sense to be called a
child of God. If the social consciousness is, as we have seen, with
any fairness to be called the recognition <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span> of the fully
personal,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_93" id="R_93"
href="#F_93">[93]</a></span> this reverence for the personal
initiative of men cannot be lacking in it. Its influence upon theology
at this point, therefore, is hardly to be doubted.</p>

<p>And theology itself is vitally concerned. For the whole possibility
of the conceptions of government and providence requires this. These
terms are words without meaning, having absolutely no place in
theology or philosophy, if man has no moral initiative. Nor should it
escape our notice, that we strike at the very root of all possible
reverence for God, if we deny a real initiative to man. We have no
possible philosophic explanation of either sin or error, consistent
with any real reverence for God, if a true human will is denied.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_94" id="R_94" href="#F_94">[94]</a></span>
In Professor Bowne's vigorous language: In a system of necessity
"every thought, belief, conviction, whether truth or superstition,
arises with equal necessity with every other.... On this plane of
necessary effect the actual is all, and the ideal distinctions of true
and false have as little meaning as they would have on the plane of
mechanical forces.... The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183"
id="page_183">{183}</a></span> only escape from the overthrow of
reason involved in the fact of error lies in the assumption of
freedom." Moreover, if real human initiative is denied to men, we
conceive God as having really less respect for persons in his dealing
with them, than the most elementary ethics requires of men in their
relations to one another. A one-sided doctrine of immanence, thus,
degrades both man and God. It degrades man, in denying to him a true
personality, and so making him simply a thing. It degrades God, in
making him the real responsible cause of all sin and error, and in
making him treat possible persons as things. The influence of the
social consciousness, which leads us to measure the moral growth of a
man and of a civilization by the deepening sense of reverence for the
person, is fairly decisive at this point. It <i>must</i> see in God
the most absolute guarding of man's personality, and especially of his
moral initiative.</p>

<p>3. <i>Man, a Child of God.</i>&mdash;The Christian faith, that man is a
child of God, is a faithful expression of the insistence of the social
consciousness upon the recognition of the full personality of man. It
expresses both man's entire dependence upon God for his being <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span> and
maintenance, and at the same time his infinite value and sacredness as
a spirit made in the image of God, capable of indefinite progress, and
capable of personal relation to God. It voices thus Christianity's
characteristic "humbly-proud" conception of man&mdash;humble in view of the
eternal and infinite plans of God; proud, as "called to an
imperishable work in the world." It is, indeed, but a concrete
statement of that faith in love at the heart of things, and in the
all-embracing plan of a faithful God, which we found required, if the
social consciousness itself was to have any justification.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_95" id="R_95"
href="#F_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h4>II. THE RECOGNITION OF THE PERSONAL IN CHRIST</h4>

<p>In the second place, under this impulse of the sense of the value
and sacredness of the person, theology is likely to insist on the
recognition of the personal in the conception of Christ.</p>

<p>1. <i>Christ a Personal Revelation of God.</i>&mdash;This recognition of
the personal in Christ will mean, first, that we are to conceive
Christ as a <i>personal</i> revelation of God, rather than as <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span>
containing in himself a divine substance.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_96" id="R_96" href="#F_96">[96]</a></span> It cannot forget,
that if God is a person, and men are persons, the adequate
self-revelation of God to men can be made only in a truly personal
life; and that men need above all, in their relation to God, some
manifestation of his ethical will, and this can be shown only in the
character of a person. A merely metaphysical conception of the
divinity of Christ in terms of substance or essence, as these are
commonly thought, must, therefore, wholly fail to satisfy. We must be
able to recognize and bow before the personal will of the personal God
revealed in Christ, if we are really to find God through him. A strong
sense of the personal, then, such as the social consciousness evinces,
must see in Christ, above all, a personal revelation of a person.</p>

<p>2. <i>Emphasizing the Moral and Spiritual in Asserting the
Supremacy of Christ.</i>&mdash;This implies that the dominant sense of the
value and sacredness of the person will certainly tend to bring into
prominence the moral and spiritual in asserting the supremacy of
Christ, rather than the metaphysical or the simply miraculous. So far
as these latter come into its representation at all, they will follow
rather <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186"
id="page_186">{186}</a></span> than precede, and be accepted because
of the moral and spiritual, or as simply working hypotheses enabling
us to bring into a thought-unity what we have to recognize in the
moral and spiritual realm. If one faces the matter fully and frankly,
is it not plain that Christians of all shades of belief are
increasingly finding the real reason for their faith in Christ in his
moral and spiritual supremacy? Many may choose to <i>express</i> their
faith in him, when once reached, in terms of the miraculous or
metaphysical; but the miraculous and the metaphysical are not the
primary <i>reasons</i> for their faith. It is the inner spirit of
Christ himself which really masters us and calls out our confident
faith and our eager submission. And it is only when we have already
gotten this sense of the stupendousness of his personality, that the
so-called miraculous in his life becomes to our thought natural and
fitting, and we are driven to think him standing in some unique
relation to God and so requiring to be conceived in unique
metaphysical terms.</p>

<p>It is easy, no doubt, to indulge in a false polemic against the
miraculous and metaphysical. One of the surest bits of autobiography
we have from Christ, the narrative of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span> the temptations,
implies, as Sanday has acutely pointed out,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_97" id="R_97" href="#F_97">[97]</a></span> the clear
consciousness on the part of Christ of the possession of what we call
supernatural powers. It is a far less simple problem to rid the
gospels of the miraculous element, than our age, with its greatly
exaggerated estimate of the mathematico-mechanical view of the world,
is likely to think. The so-called miraculous in connection with Christ
is not to be impatiently and dogmatically set aside.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_98" id="R_98" href="#F_98">[98]</a></span>
So, too, the demand of thought, that we form finally some metaphysical
conception of the great personality which we meet in Christ cannot be
denied as wholly illegitimate. All this is to be freely granted and
asserted.</p>

<p>But it is of the greatest importance for Christian thought, that it
still keep Christ's own absolute subordination of both the miraculous
and metaphysical to the moral and the spiritual. The same narrative of
the temptation, that so clearly implies supernatural powers in Christ,
has its whole point in Christ's answering determination absolutely to
subordinate these supernatural powers to moral and spiritual ends. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188"
id="page_188">{188}</a></span> whole ministry evinces the greatest
pains upon this point. And he evidently thinks a theory of his
metaphysical relation to God (as ordinarily conceived) of so little
vital importance that even such slight hints as we get of it in the
New Testament apparently do not come from him at all. The present
tendency, therefore, naturally demanded by the social consciousness,
to emphasize the moral and spiritual in Christ in asserting his
supremacy, is quite in harmony with Christ's own insistence. He will
be followed for what he is in himself.</p>

<p>The real supremacy of Christ, his truest divinity, we may be sure,
comes out for our time in those statements which we are able to make
concerning his inner spirit. Here, and here only, the real power of
his personality gets hold upon us. What are these grounds of the
supremacy of Christ? How is it that we come to God through him?</p>

<p>3. <i>The Moral and Spiritual Grounds of the Supremacy of
Christ.</i><span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_99" id="R_99"
href="#F_99">[99]</a></span>&mdash;(1) In the first place, <i>Jesus Christ
is the greatest in the greatest sphere</i>, that of the moral and
spiritual; and this, by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189"
id="page_189">{189}</a></span> common consent of all men. Both the
depth and the consensus of conviction concerning Christ are profoundly
significant. If our earth has ever seen one of whom it could be truly
said, He is a moral and spiritual authority, preëminently the one
great authority in this greatest sphere,&mdash;that person is Jesus Christ.
Seeing the moral problem more broadly than any other ever saw it,
tracing the motives of life more deeply than any other ever traced
them, applying those principles of the life which he sees with a tact
and delicacy and skill that no other ever approached, speaking with an
authority in this moral and spiritual sphere to which no other can for
a moment lay claim,&mdash;this man is easily the greatest in the greatest
sphere.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, to say only the same thing in a little different
way, when one says with Fairbairn, that Christ is transcendent among
founders of religion, "and to be transcendent here is to be
transcendent everywhere, for religion is the supreme factor in the
organizing and the regulating of our personal and collective
life."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_100" id="R_100"
href="#F_100">[100]</a></span> The present age is, more than any
other, the age of the scientific study of religion. The last forty
years, indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190"
id="page_190">{190}</a></span> have seen such attention to the study
of comparative religion as the world never saw before. What has been
the outcome of that study? To make the relative position of Jesus
among the founders of religion lower? I do not so understand it. No,
the outcome is such that it is a manifestly inadequate statement to
say, that he is transcendent among the founders of religion. The very
most that we may hope to say about the founder of any other religion
is, that in some single particular at a long distance he can be
brought into comparison with Jesus. But let one think for a moment
what it means for a man to be a founder of religion. We talk of
leadership. Do we know what a founder of religion does? He makes the
light, in which millions of men look upon all the events of their
life, in which they see the past of the world's history, in which they
look forward to the entire future. The very mood and atmosphere of
men's lives are determined by these founders of religion; and among
these preëminent leaders, Jesus, beyond all mistake, is
transcendent.</p>

<p>Let the nature of his kingdom, too, be his witness. He calmly aims
to found a kingdom that shall be spiritual, universal, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span>
eternal. One must face the fact that this man of Nazareth in Syrian
Galilee, purposes in coolness of deliberation to found a kingdom that
shall be absolutely spiritual, that shall make no appeal to any of the
lower elements of man; one must see that this man, in those
temptations through which he passed concerning the form of his work,
deliberately set aside the kingdom by bread, the kingdom by marvel and
ecstasy, and the kingdom by force, and purposed to found a kingdom
solely upon moral and spiritual forces. And observe that he
confidently expects this kingdom to be universal&mdash;appealing to men of
all races and of all times, and to be eternal&mdash;still standing when all
else shall have passed away. And upon his belief in this character of
his kingdom he stakes his life, and calmly gives to himself as the
goal of his life the establishment of just such a kingdom; and remains
to the end confident of his success. The mere vitality of will in such
a purpose is hard to take in, and alone may well give us pause.</p>

<p>And because he is the greatest in the greatest sphere, transcendent
among founders of religion, the founder of a kingdom spiritual,
universal, and eternal, he becomes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> for us a "personalized
conscience," a spiritual, moral authority for us even beyond our own
conscience&mdash;an authority that grows upon us with our growth, and
submission to which is earth's highest moral test.</p>

<p>(2) And there must be added to this first proposition, that Jesus
is the greatest in the greatest sphere, a second: <i>He alone is the
sinless and impenitent one.</i> And it is to be noticed that it is
this man who sees more clearly than any other the moral and spiritual,
who knows, as no other does, what character is and what moral life
means,&mdash;it is he, who claims to be the sinless one. No other ever
intelligently made this claim; for no other was it ever intelligently
made. The words of the great historian Ranke seem to us to be simple
truth when he says: "More guiltless and more powerful, more exalted
and more holy has naught ever been on earth than his conduct, his
life, and his death. The human race knows nothing that could be
brought even afar off into comparison with it." Only such an one could
intelligently make for himself the claim of sinlessness. And for no
other was this claim of sinlessness ever intelligently made. Men know
each other too well to make it for others when moral consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193"
id="page_193">{193}</a></span> has fully awakened. But he fights his
battle in the wilderness, and there is no record of failure so far as
he himself can see it, and none that disciple ever ascribed.</p>

<p>And this claim of sinlessness for Christ is to be urged, not so
much because of any special statements by Christ as because of that
remarkable fact to which Dr. Bushnell has called attention,&mdash;his
impenitence. Jesus alone among all good men is a man of "impenitent
piety;" and by this he is marked off absolutely from every other good
man. What happens in the life of any other good man is this: that, as
he goes forward, the sense of sin grows upon him, the ideal rises
before him and he feels increasingly that his own life is inferior to
it. Of Jesus this is not true. He shows no sign of consciousness of
failure. There is no evidence that he feels that he has fallen short
in any degree. He is absolutely without that universal characteristic
of all other good men, absolutely without penitence. Contrast him for
a moment with the man, who perhaps all would agree was the greatest of
all his disciples, the man to whose devotion there seems to be no
limit&mdash;the Apostle Paul; and notice, that years after his persecution
of the church and of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194"
id="page_194">{194}</a></span> cause of Jesus, with growing sense of
what Jesus is, and of his own inexhaustible debt to him, there comes
over him with increasing, not lessening, power the sense of his sin,
and he writes to the Ephesians, "Unto me, who am less than the least
of all saints, was this grace given me that I might preach unto the
Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;" and in one of the very
last letters that comes down to us from him, says again, "Faithful is
the saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." What evidence have we
that Christ ever felt in the slightest degree such penitence?</p>

<p>(3) But more than this is true. <i>With the highest ideal, Jesus
not only does not consciously fall short of it, but consciously rises
up to it</i>, and, as Herrmann says, "compels us to admit that he does
rise to it." It were very much that a man with any ideal, however
inferior, should be able to say to himself, I have not fallen short of
this ideal; but that one, who sees more clearly than any other in the
realm of the moral and spiritual, and who has an ideal of simply
absolute love and of unbounded trust in God,&mdash;that he should show not
only no consciousness of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195"
id="page_195">{195}</a></span> falling short, but should consciously
rise to his ideal and compel us to admit that he rises to it: this is
a fact unparalleled in the history of the world. It is far more than
mere sinlessness; there is here a positiveness of moral achievement so
great&mdash;a fact so tremendous&mdash;that we seem able but feebly to take it
in.</p>

<p>(4) And even that is not all. <i>Jesus has such a character that we
can transfer it feature by feature to God</i>, not only with no sense
of blasphemy, not only with no sense of his coming short, but with
complete satisfaction. I do not now ask at all as to any man's
metaphysical theory about Jesus Christ; I only ask that it be noticed
that those who question common theories altogether still get their
ideal of God from Jesus Christ; and that this is the wonderful thing
that has happened on our earth: that there has once lived a man&mdash;daily
moving about among men, a concrete circumstantial account of whose
life in many particulars we have&mdash;the features of whose character one
can transfer absolutely to God and say, That is what I mean by God.
One simply cannot add anything to the character of God himself in the
highest moments of his imagination, that is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span> not already revealed in
Jesus Christ. I take it that the words of Fairbairn are literally
true: he was "the first being who had realized for men the idea of the
Divine." When, therefore, Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the
Father and it sufficeth us," he could only reply as he might any day
to us, "Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me,
Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father."</p>

<p>(5) And one cannot stop here. <i>Jesus is consciously able to
redeem all men.</i> With such sense of the meaning of sin and of moral
conduct as no other ever had, understanding, therefore, the sin and
need of men as no other ever did, and having such a vision of what it
is perfectly to share the life of God as no other ever had, still,
facing the masses of men, he could say to himself, "I am able to take
these men and lift them into the very presence of God and present them
spotless before the throne of his glory." Have we taken in what it
means, that, in the consciousness of a man in form like ourselves,
there could be, even for a moment, the actual belief that he was the
one that was to take away the sin of the world, and had power to
redeem men absolutely unto God? In <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> another's words: "Jesus
knows no more sacred task than to point men to his own person." He is
himself God's greatest gift, himself "the way, the truth, the
life,"&mdash;not only fighting his own battles, but consciously able to
redeem all men.</p>

<p>(6) This simply implies, as Dr. Denison has suggested, that
<i>Jesus has such God-consciousness and such sense of mission as would
simply topple any other brain that the world has ever known into
insanity</i>, but which simply keeps him sweet, normal, rational,
living the most wholesome and simple and noble life the world has ever
seen. How are we to explain that fact? On the one hand, the sense of
being of even a little importance in the kingdom of God proves
singularly intoxicating to men. How often, when one is strongly
possessed by the idea that he is a special channel of manifestation
for God, do moral sanity, influence, and character all suffer! On the
other hand, there is no burden of suffering that men can bear so great
as suffering in the sin of one loved&mdash;thus bearing the sin of another.
But here is one who can believe that, when men come to him and simply
see him as he is, they catch their best vision of God; here is one who
bears consciously <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198"
id="page_198">{198}</a></span> the sin of all men, and who can believe
that he has absolute power to revolutionize the lives of other men and
make them what they were meant originally to be, children of God; and
yet, believing this, can, under that consciousness, keep sweet and
normal, wholesome and simple, energetically ethical and thoroughly
rational,&mdash;can keep sane. Indeed, he lives a life so sane, that, to
pass even from some of our best religious books into the simple
atmosphere of the story of his life often seems like passing from the
super-heated, artificially lighted, heavily perfumed and exhausted
atmosphere of the crowded drawing-room into the open fresh air of day
under the heaven of God. In the very act of the most stupendous
self-assertion, Jesus can still characterize himself as "meek and
lowly of heart," and we feel no self-contradiction&mdash;so completely has
he harmonized for even our unconscious feeling his transcendent
self-consciousness and his humble simplicity of life. Has the world
anywhere a phenomenon comparable to this?</p>

<p>(7) In consequence of all this, <i>Jesus is in fact the only person
in the history of the race who can call out absolute trust</i>. As
little children, we knew something of what it meant to have <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span>
complete trust. There were a few years when it seemed to us that there
was nothing in either power or character that was not true of our
fathers and mothers. We soon lost such trust, even as children. Is
there any way back to the childlike spirit? Let us ponder these golden
words of Herrmann: "The childlike spirit can only arise within us when
our experience is the same as a child's; in other words, when we meet
with a personal life which compels us to trust it without reserve.
Only the person of Jesus can arouse such trust in a man who has
awakened to moral self-consciousness. If such a man surrenders himself
to anything or any one else, he throws away not only his trust, but
himself." There has been one life lived on earth, in whose hands one
may put himself with absolute confidence and have no fear as to the
result. Jesus, and Jesus alone, can call out absolute trust.</p>

<p>(8) Moreover, <i>Jesus is the only life ever lived among men in
whom God certainly finds us, and in whom we certainly find God</i>.
And, once again, I am not now asking whether one is able to come to
any theory of the nature of Christ. That is a matter of comparative
indifference. The great fact is this: That <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> there has been lived
among us men such a life that, if a man will simply put himself in the
presence of it and stay there, he will have brought home to him with
unmistakable conviction the fact that God is, and is touching him and
that he is touching God; that, coupled with such a sense as he never
had before of his sin, there will be also the sense of forgiveness and
reconciliation with God, and so, such evidence of the contact of God
with his life as he can find nowhere else. So Harnack believes: "When
God and everything that is sacred threaten to disappear in the
darkness, or our doom is pronounced; when the mighty forces of
inexorable nature seem to overwhelm us, and the bounds of good and
evil to dissolve; when, weak and weary, we despair of finding God at
all in this dismal world,&mdash;it is then that the personality of Christ
may save us."</p>

<p>(9) And all this means, finally, that <i>Jesus is for us the ideal
realized</i>. Let not the commonplaceness of the words rob us of their
meaning. The fact is far enough from the commonplace. Philosophy must
always tell us that we have no right to expect anywhere a realized
ideal, except in the absolute whole of things. Certainly, we never
find in any <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201"
id="page_201">{201}</a></span> of the inferior spheres a fully
realized ideal. What does it mean, then, that in this highest of all
spheres, the sphere of the moral and spiritual life, we have the ideal
realized; that our very highest vision is a fact? What is there that
one would add to, what, that one would take away from, the life of
Christ, that it might be more completely than it is the ideal
realized?</p>

<p>4. <i>Christ's Double Uniqueness.</i>&mdash;It seems hardly possible to
do justice to the facts now passed in review, without recognizing, at
least, that they point to a double uniqueness on the part of Christ in
his relation to God, reflected in his own language concerning himself
and in the spontaneous confessions of his disciples in all times. He
alone, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202"
id="page_202">{202}</a></span> in the emphatic sense, is <i>the</i>
Son. The contrasts between Christ and other men, which the simple
facts of the life and consciousness of Christ have compelled us to
make, naturally, then, demand recognition from thought. The
recognition of the facts <i>is</i> the vital matter, but thought can
hardly see them unmoved. How are we to <i>think</i> of Christ? With
clear remembrance, now, that Christian teaching itself insists upon
the kinship of God and men; that absolute barriers, therefore, cannot
anywhere be set up; that a revelation unrelated to all else could be
no revelation; and that Christ himself often pointed out the likeness
between his own life and work and those of his disciples;&mdash;still we
may not ignore actual differences, and must honestly strive to do
justice to them in our own conception of Christ. One may not forget
that there is much here that we can hardly hope ever to fathom; and
that into this secret of Christ's relation to the Father theology has
often tried to press with a precision of statement that was quite
beyond its possible knowledge, and that damaged rather than helped the
religious consciousness; but one may try to think in simple,
straightforward fashion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203"
id="page_203">{203}</a></span> what the facts mean. Now these actual
and momentous moral and spiritual differences already pointed out
seem, at least, to assert, I say, a genuine double uniqueness in
Christ. Christ's relation to God is absolutely unique, that is, in two
senses: in the absolutely unique purpose of God concerning him; in the
absolutely perfect response of Christ to that purpose. If one chooses
to use the language, he may say, that the first uniqueness is
metaphysical; the second, ethical.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_101" id="R_101" href="#F_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>First, then, God has a purpose concerning Christ, that he has
concerning no other, for he purposes to make in him his supreme
self-manifestation. This sets him apart from all others. His
transcendent sense of God and sense of mission only correspond to the
absolute uniqueness of this eternal purpose of God concerning him. We
are utterly unable to see that they could be borne by any being that
we know as man. He is the manifested God&mdash;"the visible presentation of
the invisible God." This cannot be said, in the same sense, of any
other. Now, our only adequate statement of the inner reality&mdash;the
essential meaning&mdash;of any being, can be given only in terms of the
purpose which God calls <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204"
id="page_204">{204}</a></span> that being to fulfil. To see, then,
that God's purpose concerning Christ is absolutely unique, and that
God's purpose is, to make in Christ the completest possible personal
manifestation of himself, is to see that Christ's essential relation
to the Father is absolutely his own, unshared by any other. And, it
may be added, there is no reason why this purpose of God concerning
Christ should not be regarded as an eternal purpose, eternally
realized.</p>

<p>But Christ is as clearly unique in his simply perfect response to
this purpose of God. Our facts seem to point directly to the
conclusion, that in him there was no moral hindrance to the fullness
of the revelation God would make through him. His life is perfectly
transparent, allowing the full glory of the character of God to shine
through it. The harmony of his will with God's will is complete. If it
be said that this last uniqueness is, after all, only difference in
degree from other men, it must be answered, first, that degree here is
so vast as to be practically kind. This is the perfect of Christ set
over against the varyingly imperfect of all other men. Moreover, to
ask here for difference in kind in any other <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> sense, is probably to
make an unintelligent and impossible demand; for, in the nature of the
case, the relations involved are spiritual and personal, and there
cannot be, in strictness, in the fulfilment of such relations any real
differences in kind.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Increasing Sense of Our Kinship with Christ, and of His
Reality.</i>&mdash;Side by side with this recognition of the nature of
Christ's uniqueness, there deserves to be set, as another outcome of
the emphasis upon conceiving Christ as a personal revelation of God,
the increasing sense of our kinship with Christ and of his reality.
The connection here is by no means accidental, though it may seem
almost paradoxical. We have plainly come in our day to our clearest
recognition of the divinity of Christ through the sense of his
transcendent character. But revelation in character requires the
reality of his human life. The very route, therefore, by which we have
most certainly reached our sense of Christ's divinity, leads also to
an increasing sense of kinship with Christ, and so of his reality. So
long as we seemed driven to conceive the divinity of Christ in terms
that had no relation and no meaning for human life, just so long must
he seem <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206"
id="page_206">{206}</a></span> to us to be really moving in another
world and to take on the unreality of that other world quite hidden
from us. But now Christ's life has meaning; we can enter into it and
feel that it is real. With all its transcendence, the life does not
move now simply in the sphere of the mysterious. It is no unreal
drama, no play-struggle,&mdash;utterly failing to meet our real moral and
spiritual needs. Least of all, in this supreme work for man, can the
revealing life be only a show. It feels real. It is real. And, with
clear sense of the inevitable inadequacy of the analogy, we still rest
confidently in the conviction that God's relation to Christ may be
best conceived after the analogy of the relation of the Spirit of God
to our spirits; and that, when we try to press beyond that, we are
attempting to rise into that sphere of a supposed supra-personal, for
which we have no possible organ of vision, and where, therefore, we
are thinking not more, but less, truly.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_102" id="R_102" href="#F_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>With this sense of the reality of the personal, spiritual life of
Christ, there naturally comes home to us the appropriateness and
<i>practicability of his ideals</i>. They are seen to belong to us
more surely, and properly to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207"
id="page_207">{207}</a></span> make demands upon us. It is, probably,
not too much to say that, under the influence of the social
consciousness, there has been a definite, growing approach to Christ's
way of thinking, and to his ideal of life. This means a consciousness
increasingly Christian in tone, and, therefore, in turn, increasingly
better able to interpret the teaching and life of Christ, and so to
give promise of a more Christian theology. None of us, probably, are
fully conscious of the more subtle inconsistencies of even our best
theological thinking, when measured by a completely Christian spirit.
At least, with the insistence upon Christ as a personal revealer of a
personal God, it must become more true that the meaning of all terms
for the work of Christ shall be more clearly reasonable, more
consistently ethical, and more completely spiritual; and then the
immediate rooting of Christian theology in the Christian religion can
be seen and felt.</p>

<h4>III. THE RECOGNITION OF THE PERSONAL IN GOD</h4>

<p>The sense of the value and sacredness of the person must lead to
the special recognition of the personal not only in man and in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span>
Christ, but also in God. We have already seen reasons for believing
that the social consciousness is peculiarly bound strongly to
emphasize the personality of God, as in the end absolutely essential
to its own justification. The social consciousness represents an
ethical movement that can live only in the atmosphere of the
personal.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Steady Carrying through of the Completely Personal in the
Conception of God. Guarding the Conception.</i>&mdash;This pressure of the
social consciousness toward an imperative faith in the fully personal
God is most valuable, as offsetting the tendency in many quarters
toward a scientific or even idealistic pantheism or monism that is
quite impersonal. "For," in the language of Professor Howison, "the
very quality of personality is, that a person is a being who
recognizes others as having a reality as unquestionable as his own,
and who thus sees himself as a member of a moral republic, standing to
other persons in an immutable relationship of reciprocal duties and
rights, himself endowed with dignity, and acknowledging the dignity of
all the rest."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_103" id="R_103"
href="#F_103">[103]</a></span> As this is preëminently the spirit of
the social consciousness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209"
id="page_209">{209}</a></span> it is plain that we have in the social
consciousness an increasingly powerful motive for guarding the full
personality of God.</p>

<p>It needs particularly to be noted, that we know no <i>definite</i>
"supra-personal." Pantheism or any impersonal monism is forced,
therefore, when it leaves the personal conception of God, to take a
lower line of development, not a higher. The result is, that it is
obliged to deny the highest attributes to God, and then, as Browning
is fond of arguing, man steps at once into the place of God. Men
cannot permanently remain satisfied with a philosophical view, of
which that is the logical outcome. Certainly, such a view can get no
support from the social consciousness, with its deep conviction of the
supreme value and sacredness of the person.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not to be forgotten, in estimating the value of a
cosmic monism, that what the cosmological really means, ethically and
religiously, to a people, must always depend upon their social ideals.
The natural in itself contains no command. For any effective vital
interpretation, therefore, even of its impersonal Absolute, pantheism
is constantly thrown back upon the personal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210"
id="page_210">{210}</a></span> Only a clear, steady carrying through
by theology of the completely personal in its conception of God can
ultimately satisfy this sense of the value and sacredness of the
person. Professor Nash does not speak too strongly when he says: "To
fulfil her function the church must develop the doctrine of a Divine
Personality. She has not always been true to it in the past. Too
often, by her sacraments, by her theology, by her theory of
inspiration, she has glorified the impersonal."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_104" id="R_104"
href="#F_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, such an attempt, it is perhaps worth saying once more, is not
to be thought of as a running away from a thorough-going metaphysical
investigation. It rather takes the ground, indicated in the earlier
discussion, of what may be called, in Professor Howison's language,
personal idealism; and holds that spirit, person, <i>is</i> for us the
ultimate metaphysical fact: the one reality to which we have immediate
access; the reality from which all our metaphysical notions are
originally derived; and, in consequence, the one reality which we can
take as the key to the understanding of all else. And it believes that
even essence and substance, the great <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span> words of the old
metaphysics, can be really understood only as they are interpreted in
personal terms. Ultimately, theology would hold, this would mean the
interpretation of the essence of things in terms of the purpose of God
concerning them&mdash;what he meant them to be.</p>

<p>In the attempt, then, clearly and steadily to carry through the
conception of God as completely personal, theology may well guard
carefully certain points. In the first place, theology does not mean
to transfer to God human limitations; rather, it conceives him to be
the only complete personality with perfect self-consciousness and full
freedom, no part of whose being is in any degree foreign to himself.
Nor, in the second place, does it mean to forget that the personal
relations in which God stands to other persons are unique, and that,
in three definite respects: that conviction of the love of God, as of
no other, must underlie, as a great necessary assumption, all our
thinking and all our living; that God is himself the source of the
moral constitution of man, which must thus be regarded as an
expression of the personal will of God, and the personal relation to
God so have universal moral implications such as <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span> no
other personal relation can have; and in that God is such in his
universal love for all, that it is impossible to come into right
personal relation to God, and not at the same time come into right
relation to all moral beings.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_105"
id="R_105" href="#F_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>God is Always the Completely Personal God.</i>&mdash;If, now,
theology is to do justice to the demands of the social consciousness
for a full recognition of the personal in God, it must see clearly
that God is <i>always</i> the completely personal God. Certain
conclusions, not always admitted, are believed to follow from this
position.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Consequent Relation of God to "Eternal Truths."</i>&mdash;In
the first place, there can be no sphere of eternal truths, thought of
as either created outright by the will of God, or as existing of
themselves independently of God and only to be recognized by him.</p>

<p>The difficulty is not merely that at least one of these views would
put God in the same dependent relation to truth as we finite beings,
and thus practically put a God above God. Nor is the difficulty merely
that it is impossible to think the real existence of such a sphere of
eternal truth, since truths <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213"
id="page_213">{213}</a></span> or laws can be said to exist only in
one of two ways: either as the actual mode of action of reality, or as
the perception and formulation in an observing mind of that mode of
action. And these difficulties are both sufficiently serious.</p>

<p>But, from our present point of view, the great difficulty is, that
trying to conceive God as either creating or coming to the recognition
of truth, assumes, as Lotze points out, a <i>fragmentary</i> God, a
God for whom truth is <i>not yet</i>. It assumes an action of the will
of God apart from his reason, that is, a God not yet completely
personal, not yet the full God of truth and character. A God for whom
truth and duty are not yet, is certainly no true person. Most, if not
all, of our metaphysical puzzles connected with the relation of God to
what we call eternal truths, seem to me to grow out of this thought of
an essentially fragmentary God.</p>

<p>We are driven, consequently, to a denial of both the Scotist and
Thomist positions, as ordinarily conceived. It is true neither that
the truth is true and the good is good because God wills it, nor yet
that God wills the true because it is true and the good because it is
good. Both views alike assume <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214"
id="page_214">{214}</a></span> the possibility of a fragmentary God, a
God for whom at some time truth and goodness were not yet. But God has
<i>always</i> been the completely personal God of truth and love,
never a bare will and never a bare intellect. Hence, neither as an
independent object to be recognized, nor yet as the external product
of his will, can we think of the realm of eternal truth and goodness.
We must rather say, God alone is the eternal being and absolute source
of all, always complete in the perfection of his personality; and,
therefore, what we call the eternal truths are only <i>the eternal
modes of God's actual activity</i>. This alone seems to the writer to
give a thorough-going theistic view, free from
self-contradiction.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_106" id="R_106"
href="#F_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Eternal Creation.</i>&mdash;But, further, if God is to be thought
as <i>always</i> the completely personal God, we are led, also,
immediately to the doctrine of eternal creation.</p>

<p>If God has had always a completely personal life, his entire being
must have been always in exercise. Can we really think of such a God
as simply quiescent, and not as always active? Is not his activity
involved in his complete personality? The thought <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> of
his possible quiescence arises probably out of an unconscious, but
nevertheless unwarranted, transfer to God of our finite separation of
will and act. But God is here, too, no fragmentary God; he has always
been the completely personal God, always acting.</p>

<p>A second consideration carries us to the same conclusion.
Theologians have felt that they have made a distinct step in advance
in tracing creation to love in God, as, for example, Principal
Fairbairn does. But this gives no real help as an explanation of
creation as <i>beginning in time</i>; for one must at once ask, Was
not the love of God eternal, and if this were the real reason leading
to creation, must not, then, creation be eternal?</p>

<p>So far as I am able to see, there is nothing to lose and much to
gain in clearness and satisfactoriness of thought in a frank
acceptance of the doctrine of eternal creation. Not, of course, in the
sense of an eternal dualism, in the sense of the thought of an
eternity of matter set over against God, but in the clear sense of the
eternal creative activity of God. And to such a doctrine of eternal
creation, the social consciousness, in its emphasis on the completely
personal, seems to me to lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216"
id="page_216">{216}</a></span> (3) <i>The Unity and Unchangeableness
of God.</i>&mdash;And, once more, if God is always the completely personal
God, we shall conceive his own unity not as monotonous self-identity,
but only as consistency of meaning. We shall not, therefore, transfer
to God, pluming ourselves meanwhile upon a highly philosophical view,
the mechanical unchangeableness of a rock; but we shall be rather
concerned with the consistency of his character and the
unchangeableness of his loving will, which would be the very reasons
for his changing, adapting attitude toward his changing children. From
this point of view, too, the sphere of law and the sphere of the
actual, will seem to us, necessarily, to root in the sphere of the
ideal; the <i>is</i> and the <i>must</i>, to rest in the <i>ought</i>;
though we may not hope to trace the connections in detail. In a God,
then, who is a completely harmonious person, never acting in
fragmentary fashion, whose will and whose reason and whose love are
never at cross purposes&mdash;only in such a God can the world find its
adequate and unifying source. The world itself has real unity only in
so far as it is the expression of the consistency of meaning of the
purpose of God concerning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217"
id="page_217">{217}</a></span> And this same thought of the
consistency of the meaning of the purpose of God, I have elsewhere
argued,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_107" id="R_107"
href="#F_107">[107]</a></span> saves us from the necessity of a
self-contradictory conception of the miraculous or supernatural, by
its recognition of the dominant spiritual order. It also enables us to
see, with Professor Nash, if the word personal is given sufficient
breadth, that "the true supernatural is the personal, and wheresoever
the personal is discovered, whether in the life of conscience or the
life of reason, whether in Israel or Greece, there the supernatural is
discovered. Upon this conception of the supernatural as the personal,
apologetics must found the claims of Christianity. The divine and the
human personality stand within 'Nature,' that is, within the total of
being. But they both, the human as well as the divine, transcend the
scope and reach of visible Nature."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_108" id="R_108" href="#F_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <i>The Limitations of the Conception of Immanence.</i>&mdash;Indeed,
it ought to be clearly recognized on all sides by those who believe in
religion at all, that we cannot so exclusively emphasize the immanence
of God, as many are now doing, and have a God at <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span> all,
beyond the finite manifestations. When the matter is so conceived,
there is no real personal God with whom there can be any personal
communion. Religion, thus, in any ordinary sense of it, is by this
process made simply impossible; Positivism is the only logical result,
and Frederic Harrison becomes the one sole, clear-sighted prophet
among us, a lone voice crying in the wilderness. Such an outcome is
possible for any, because, and in so far as, they are not true to the
social consciousness in its demand for the completely personal God,
who, in Martineau's language, is a genuinely "free spirit."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_109" id="R_109"
href="#F_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Deepening the Thought of the Fatherhood of God.</i>&mdash;But the
influence of the social consciousness in its deepening sense of the
value and sacredness of the person, of obligation and of love, not
only tends to insist upon the completely personal in the conception of
God, but also tends to deepen our thought of the Fatherhood of
God.</p>

<p>(1) <i>History no Mere Natural Process.</i>&mdash;No mere on-going of an
unfeeling Absolute, whatever name be given it, will ever satisfy the
social consciousness. The new sense of the sorrow and ethical meaning
of the historical <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219"
id="page_219">{219}</a></span> process demands, in the first place,
that history shall not be regarded as a mere necessitated development,
but a movement in which men effectively coöperate, never more
consciously and clearly than to-day; and secondly, it demands a
<i>God</i> who cares, who loves, who guides. History cannot be a mere
holocaust to God.</p>

<p>(2) <i>God, the Great Servant.</i>&mdash;Rather, as we saw in the fourth
chapter, the social consciousness requires a God whose purpose shall
completely support its own purpose, and so requires us, with
Fairbairn, to put Fatherhood before Sovereignty, not Sovereignty
before Fatherhood, and requires us definitely to conceive God after
Christ, as self-giving ministering love. It is one of the anomalies of
Christian history, that the church has been so slow to cast off a
pagan conception of God, and to come to a truly Christian view. We can
hardly take in Christ's own revelation of God without some sharing in
his sympathy for men. Some experience of our own is needed to unlock
the revelation. And, so, the steady deepening of the social
consciousness, both as to the value of the person and as to the sense
of obligation, has certainly helped us to see that if God is to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span> be
highest, he must be love, and thus the great servant, with
transcendent obligations, entering really and sympathetically into all
our life.</p>

<p>(3) <i>No Divine Arbitrariness.</i>&mdash;With such a conception of God,
every trace of arbitrariness disappears. Calvinism, however
strenuously insisted upon, means a far different thing for any man who
really feels the pressure of the modern social consciousness, who has
come to some real sense of the value and sacredness of the person,
that is, who really sees God in Christ. The great truth of Calvinism,
that God is the ultimate source of all, was perhaps never more secure
than to-day; but that God, who is the absolute and ultimate source of
all, is the fully personal God, whose will is never divorced from his
reason and love, who knows no such abstraction as a bare and empty
omnipotence without content or direction, but who is himself always
living love. The bane of much so-called Calvinism is in this
supposition of a fragmentary God, like a motion without direction or
rate of speed. Arbitrary decrees are conceivable only from such a
fragmentary God, not yet full and complete in his reality and
personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221"
id="page_221">{221}</a></span> (4) <i>The Passibility of God.</i>&mdash;It
would seem, also, that any vital defense of the Fatherhood of God,
required by the social consciousness, involves further the frank
admission of the passibility of God, whether it has the look of an
ancient heresy or not. We must unhesitatingly admit that, without
which God can be no real God to us. "Theology has no falser idea than
that of the impassibility of God. If he is capable of sorrow, he is
capable of suffering, and were he without the capacity for either he
would be without any feeling of the evil of sin or the misery of man.
The very truth that comes by Jesus Christ may be said to be summed up
in the passibility of God."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_110"
id="R_110" href="#F_110">[110]</a></span> With the growing
sensitiveness of the social consciousness, the problem of suffering
and of sin presses increasingly, and itself almost compels the
assertion of the passibility of God. Nothing less can satisfy our
hearts, nor indeed allow us to keep our reverence for God.</p>

<p>Certainly, with the increasingly clear vision, which the social
consciousness is giving us, of sympathetic, unselfish, definitely
self-sacrificing, loving leadership even among men, we shall not rest
satisfied with less in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222"
id="page_222">{222}</a></span> God. We must have a suffering, seeking,
loving God; because our Father, suffering in our sin, bearing as a
burden the sin of each, and not satisfied while one child turns away;
no mere on-looker, but in all our afflictions, himself afflicted. The
cross of Christ, then, is only an honest showing of the actual facts
of God's seeking, suffering love.</p>

<p>4. <i>As to the Doctrine of a Social Trinity.</i>&mdash;One inference
for theology widely drawn from the social consciousness, it ought in
fairness, perhaps, to be said, seems to me unjustified,&mdash;the doctrine
of a so-called "Social Trinity." One must question the constant cool
assumption made in these discussions of a social Trinity, that this
view is the only alternative to what is called an "abstract
simplicity." In any case, one would suppose, we must have in God all
the richness and complexity of a complete personal life, freed from
the limitations of finite personality. Something of the much that that
involves we have been trying to point out. Here certainly is no
"abstract simplicity."</p>

<p>Moreover, the conception of a social Trinity, so far as the writer
can see, carries us inevitably to a tritheism of the most unmistakable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223"
id="page_223">{223}</a></span> kind. "Social" involves full
personality. Nothing requires more complete personality than love,
which the view affirms to exist between the persons of the immanent
Trinity, between the distinctions in the very Godhead. The relations
of Christ to God were, of course, distinctly and definitely personal;
but it must not be forgotten that we are not permitted, on any careful
theological view, to transfer these directly to the immanent relations
of the Godhead.</p>

<p>The distinction drawn by Dr. W. N. Clarke,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_111" id="R_111" href="#F_111">[111]</a></span> between the
doctrine of the biblical Trinity and the doctrine of the Triunity, I
count of decided value; but after one has made the distinction, one
may doubt the value of the contribution made by the doctrine of the
Triunity. The really immanent relations of the Godhead are necessarily
hidden from us, and are, also, so far as the writer can see, without
ethical or religious significance for us, except in the way of
possible injury through substituting some supposed altogether
mysterious and incomprehensibly sacred, for the well-known and truly
sacred shown in the ethical relations of common life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224"
id="page_224">{224}</a></span> The doctrine of the Triunity seems to
have been originally intended to enable the church to hold the
divinity of Christ. If we now get at that and hold that from quite a
different point of view, the older way becomes less essential. We
must, indeed, keep the ancient treasure, but we need not keep it in
the same ancient chest. None of us&mdash;not the most orthodox&mdash;really find
the <i>reasons</i> for holding the divinity of Christ in the doctrine
of the Triunity. It is interesting to observe how widely separated
from the doctrine of the Triunity are the considerations which really
move men to faith in the divinity of Christ. That doctrine is, at the
very most, only our philosophical supplement intended to bring that,
which on other grounds we have come to believe, into unity with our
thought of God.</p>

<p>But, at least, we must so conceive the divinity of Christ, as not
to get two or three Gods. And a "Social Trinity" does not seem to me
to avoid that, except in terms. However, therefore, we are to solve
our problem, we are not to take <i>that</i> way out.</p>

<p>What Dr. Clarke calls the biblical doctrine of the Trinity, on the
other hand, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225"
id="page_225">{225}</a></span> seems to me to contain the very heart
of Christianity, whatever philosophical theory we put beneath it; and
it became, therefore, as expressed in the baptismal and benediction
formulas, the great daily confession of the church, since it strongly
expresses that of which we have been speaking,&mdash;the living love of
God, a life of absolutely self-giving love, of eternal ministry.</p>

<p>The biblical Trinity is, in truth, what it has sometimes been
called, the trinity of redemption; and, for me, directly emphasizes
the great facts of redemption. Here there are three great facts:
First, the Fatherhood of God, that God is in his very being Father,
Love, self-manifesting as light, self-giving as life,
self-communicating, pouring himself out into the life of his children,
wishing to share his highest life with them, every one. Second, the
concrete, unmistakable revelation of the Father in Christ, revealed in
full ethical perfection, as an actual fact to be known and
experienced; no longer an unknown, hidden, or only partially and
imperfectly revealed God, but a real, living God of character,
counting as a real, appreciable, but fully spiritual fact in the real
world. And, third, the Father revealing himself by his Spirit in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span>
every <i>individual</i> heart that opens itself to him, in a constant,
intimate, divine association, which yet is never obtrusive, but
reverent of the man's personality, making possible to every man the
ideal conditions of the richest life.</p>

<p>What metaphysical theory we put under that confession of our full
Christian faith, does not seem to me to be of prime importance. Men
may count it of great importance; but it can hardly be of first
importance, since, at the very most, only the beginnings of such a
theory can be found in the great New Testament confession of
Christ.</p>

<p>5. <i>Preëminent Reverence for Personality, Characterizing all
God's Relations with Men.</i>&mdash;But the very heart of the conviction,
on the part of the social consciousness, of the value and sacredness
of the person, is its <i>reverence for personality</i>; and this
thought has much significance for theology, for, if this judgment of
the social consciousness is justified, it must be regarded as
preëminently characterizing God in all his relations with men.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Reflected in Christ.</i>&mdash;When, in the first place, we turn
to Christ as the supreme revelation of God, we cannot fail to see that
this reverence for the personal marks every <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span> step he takes. It
begins, of course, in the priceless value which Christ gives to each
person, as a child of the living, loving Father.</p>

<p>And it seems to determine his <i>whole method</i> with his
generation and with his disciples. It is shown in the initial battle
in the temptations, as to the form his work was to take, and as to the
means to be employed. There was here, as we have seen, from the start
an absolute subordination of all unspiritual and unethical methods in
the building of the kingdom. There is to be no over-riding of the free
personality anywhere. He faced successively the temptations to place
his dependence on the mere meeting of men's material needs&mdash;the
kingdom by bread; the temptation to place his dependence on that which
appealed most strongly to the oriental mind&mdash;the use of wonder-working
power&mdash;the kingdom by marvel or ecstasy; the temptation to place his
dependence on force&mdash;the kingdom by force. But Christ sees clearly
that God is no mere supplier of bread; that God is no mere
wonder-worker, no mere giver of wonderful experiences; and that God is
not a tyrant to conquer by force. Everywhere, therefore, he sets aside
whatever may override the free personality. He would replace <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span> all
the attractive and seemingly rapid methods of the kingdom by bread,
the kingdom by marvel, and the kingdom by force, with the slow and
tedious and costly but reverent method of the spiritual kingdom by
spiritual means, the kingdom of God by God's way&mdash;of a trust freely
won, a humility spontaneously arising, a love gladly given. He can
take no pleasure in any kingdom but one of free persons.</p>

<p>In the same way, in his dealings with the inner circle of his
disciples, there seems to have been the most scrupulous regard for
their own needed initiative. He apparently makes no clear announcement
of himself as Messiah even to the disciples until late in his public
ministry, and, then, only after they have been brought, through weeks,
if not months, of unusually close personal contact and impression of
his spirit, into their own confession of him. He steadily abjures,
that is, all dogmatism about himself, and leads them along by a purely
spiritual method to a confession of him, that may be truly their own.
There is no piling up of proof-texts from the Old Testament, to show
that he is the Messiah. He seems never to have attempted any proof
with his disciples. Indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229"
id="page_229">{229}</a></span> he seems purposely to have chosen the
rather ambiguous title, "the Son of Man," that men might be left free
to come by moral choice to him.</p>

<p>The surpassingly significant fact, that Christ's chief work in the
establishment of the kingdom of God, as seems to me beyond doubt, was
his personal association with a few men; that, probably, a full third,
perhaps more, of his very brief so-called public ministry was taken up
with a period of definitely sought comparative retirement with the
inner circle of the disciples&mdash;all this points to the same recognition
of the fundamental importance in Christ's eyes of such a reverence for
the person. The kingdom of God can be founded only by the full winning
of free persons into his discipleship. The kingdom is first and last a
kingdom of free persons, in Dr. Mulford's language, always a "Republic
of God." Professor Peabody's emphasis on the essential importance of
Christ's individualism, that "Jesus approaches life from within,
through the inspiration of the individual,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_112" id="R_112" href="#F_112">[112]</a></span> it need not be
said, goes upon the same assumption of Christ's reverence for the
person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230"
id="page_230">{230}</a></span> In his really public ministry the same
spirit appears; for Jesus seems to me here constantly to be standing
with a kind of moral shudder between the spirit of contempt in the
Pharisees and Sadducees, and the outraged personality of the common
people, even of the publicans and sinners. He feels the contempt even
for these least, as a blow in his own face.</p>

<p>That glimpse which the Revelation gives us of Christ standing and
knocking at the heart's closed door, is a true picture forevermore not
only of the attitude of Christ's earthly life, but of God's eternal
relation to us. Men may over-ride and outrage us, and even think that
they show the more love thereby; God, never. This principle, then, we
may take as absolutely crucial, in our judgment of God's dealings with
us.</p>

<p>(2) <i>In Creation.</i>&mdash;It is fundamental even in creation. The
very fact of the creation of persons implies it. Such a creation can
have no significance, if, in the language already quoted from Howison,
God's "consciousness is void of that recognition and reverence of the
personal initiative of other minds which is at once the sign and the
test of the true person."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231"
id="page_231">{231}</a></span> And if love is, for a moment, to be
thought of as the motive of creation, it required for any satisfaction
of it, persons who could freely respond to that love.</p>

<p>The definite bestowal of the fateful gift of moral freedom, with
the practical certainty of sin&mdash;the creation of beings who could
choose against him&mdash;shows how deeply planted in the very being of God
is this principle of reverence for the person.</p>

<p>Here, too, the impossibility of arbitrary divine decrees meets us.
This would be treating a person as a thing, and God himself may not do
that and remain God. If a man cannot see his way to a faith both in
the divine foreknowledge and in the moral initiative of men,
therefore, he must not hesitate to choose even the divine nescience of
the free acts of men, rather than think of God as compelling men. Our
whole moral universe tumbles about our ears, if he who is the source
of all is not in earnest with persons. And yet there is much
theological thinking, of which the common notions of a personal reign
of Christ on the earth may be taken as an example, that practically
looks to a kingdom by compulsion. A kingdom of free spirits cannot be
merely decreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232"
id="page_232">{232}</a></span> (3) <i>In Providence.</i>&mdash;And this
same principle of reverence for personality must be felt to be the
guiding motive and key, as well, in the providence and government of
God. God keeps his hands off. He must so act as to call out, not to
suppress, individual initiative.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the deepest reason for a sphere of law, that
there may be a realm in which a person can have his own free
development, uninterfered with by any moral compulsion.</p>

<p>If, now, this sphere of law is to be any true training ground for
character, as we saw in the third chapter, results must not be
forthwith set aside, the mutual influence of men must hold all along
the line.</p>

<p>Even in the case of great evils, God does not step in at once to
set things right. Character is an exceedingly costly product. This is
no play-world, either as to mutual influence or as to freedom. God
guards most jealously the freedom and personality of men. He never
forgets that character must be from within. He will not accept, as
Christ would not, a faith compelled by "signs." Hence, too, we are
left to <i>ask</i>, and much is left to depend on our asking. So,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233"
id="page_233">{233}</a></span> also, God does not remove all
difficulties and give sight in place of faith. He seems even careless,
often, of how things go; for he would not only appeal to the heroic in
us, but he wishes to make it impossible for us to confuse prudence and
virtue in ourselves or others, and so to give us the opportunity and
the joy of a real moral victory, of knowing that we have made a
genuinely unselfish surrender to the right.</p>

<p>In the light of this deep-lying principle of God's sacred reverence
for the person, one learns to hush his former complaints, and with
full heart to thank God that he lives in a world where righteousness
and happiness do not always seem to fall together, and where,
therefore, he can "serve God for naught." Oh, let us know, that it is
not that God does not care, but that he cares so much&mdash;too much to
sacrifice to present comfort the character of the child he loves&mdash;too
much to shut him out from his highest opportunity.</p>

<p>(4) <i>In Our Personal Religious Life.</i>&mdash;And the same principle
holds in our personal religious life. The unobtrusiveness of God's
relation to us, of which we often complain, is rather to be taken as
evidence of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234"
id="page_234">{234}</a></span> sacred respect for our own moral
initiative, and proof of his careful adaptation to our moral need.
Wherever a strong personality is in relation to a weaker, the stronger
must maintain a conscientious self-restraint, lest he dominate the
personality of the other, to the other's moral injury and to the
hindering of his individuality. It <i>is</i> possible for a boy to be
injuriously "tied to his mother's apron-strings." Much more is it
necessary that God's relation to us should not be obtrusive. God must
guard our freedom and our individuality. He must even take pains to
hide his hand, as a strong, influential, but wise friend would do. As
we go higher, our life is and must be increasingly one of faith, the
Father's relation less and less obtrusive.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_113" id="R_113" href="#F_113">[113]</a></span> The times of
vision are given to make us patient in our progress toward the goal.
And after the vision comes often what Rendel Harris calls "the dark
night of faith, when every step has to be taken in absolute dependence
upon God and assurance that the vision was truth and was no lie."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_114" id="R_114"
href="#F_114">[114]</a></span> We need the invisible God for
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235"
id="page_235">{235}</a></span> It is for this reason, no doubt, that
God makes so rare use of overwhelming experiences in the religious
life. He would be chosen with clear and rational self-consciousness,
and so he rarely overpowers. And even in experiences which seem most
overpowering, if the person is really awake to their true ethical and
spiritual import, they will probably be found delicately adapted to
call out the individual's own response. But for most of us such
experiences prove a real temptation, because we allow the passively
emotional to absorb our attention, and so lose the ethical and
spiritual fruit. Where these marvelous experiences have been most
marked, and have plainly given real help, they seem still, usually, to
have been needed because of some false conception of God and the
spiritual world that required a powerful corrective. Here they seem
really to have been granted, as probably the transfiguration of Christ
was to the disciples, as a concession to men's weakness, God
consenting reluctantly to use for the time a lower line of appeal,
because men are unable to rise to the higher appeal.</p>

<p>We have already seen the danger of the neo-platonic over-estimation
of emotional <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236"
id="page_236">{236}</a></span> experience, and of sudden and magical
crises in religion; and this danger is especially seen in much that is
said concerning the work of the Holy Spirit. It seems as if it were
simply true, for many earnest and sincere Christians, that the
superstitions, which they had conscientiously put aside elsewhere in
religion, all came back in their thought of the work of the Spirit.
Here their relation to God has ceased to be thought of as a personal
or moral or truly spiritual one; and they are looking more or less
definitely for bodily thrills, for marked and overwhelming emotional
experiences, or for sudden transformations&mdash;hardly to be called
transformations of character&mdash;in the passive half-magical removal of
temptations altogether. That is, they are looking for moral and
spiritual results from unmoral and unspiritual processes. The exact
point is this: Doubtless we are not narrowly to limit what the
personal influence of the personal Spirit of God may do in
transforming human life&mdash;the possibilities probably far transcend what
we think&mdash;but we are clearly to see that the relation is personal,
that the influence is spiritual and under strictly ethical conditions,
if we are to escape from simply pagan superstition. Let us see <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span>
that, if God is a Personal Spirit and not an impersonal substance,
then, as Herrmann says, he "communes with us through manifestations of
his inner life, and when he consciously and purposely makes us feel
what his mind is, then we feel himself."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_115" id="R_115" href="#F_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>And, then, let us add, as has been already earlier said, that the
deepening life in the Spirit becomes plainly a deepening personal
friendship and communion with God, with laws&mdash;those of a growing
friendship&mdash;that we may study and know and obey; and among these laws,
none is of more central importance than this of the reverence for the
person.</p>

<p>(5) <i>In the Judgment.</i>&mdash;And when we turn to God's relation to
us in the judgment, we can be sure, I think, of a further application
of this principle, contrary to common teaching and expectation. We
have no reason to look forward to a time when the secrets of all, or
of any, hearts shall be laid bare to all. In so doing, God would
violate, it seems to me, the principle of his entire dealing with men,
and give the lie to his own revelation in Christ and in history. For
myself, Dr. Clarke's words carry immediate conviction: <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span> "No
man needs to know the secrets of his neighbor, and be able to trace
the justice of God through his neighbor's life, and no man who
respects the sacredness of individuality will desire it. Neither
revelation of his own secrets nor knowledge of another's seems a good
thing to a self-respecting soul."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_116" id="R_116" href="#F_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the judgment itself proceeds, no doubt, in clear recognition
of the free personality. We are "judged by the law of liberty." And we
really choose our own destiny, as Phillips Brooks suggests in one of
his most striking paragraphs. "By this law we shall be judged. How
simple and sublime it makes the judgment day! We stand before the
great white throne and wait our verdict. We watch the closed lips of
the Eternal Judge, and our hearts stand still until those lips shall
open and pronounce our fate, heaven or hell. The lips do not open. The
Judge just lifts his hand and raises from each soul before him every
law of constraint whose pressure has been its education. He lifts the
laws of constraint, and their results are manifest. The real intrinsic
nature of each soul leaps to the surface. Each soul's law of liberty
becomes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239"
id="page_239">{239}</a></span> supreme. And each soul, without one
word of commendation or approval, by its own inner tendency, seeks its
own place.... The freeing of souls is the judging of souls. A
liberated nature dictates its own destiny. Could there be a more
solemn judgment seat? Is it not a fearful thing to be judged by the
law of liberty?"<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_117" id="R_117"
href="#F_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>And we may be most certain, that, in any judgment by God, there can
be no thought of "human waste." The man must remain for God, to the
end, a child of God, a person of sacredness and value, to be dealt
with always as capable of character. And it is along just this line
that, independently of exegetical grounds, it seems to me, we are led
to a decisive rejection of the doctrine of annihilation. And I know no
more convincing putting of the matter than this brief but
comprehensive statement of Fairbairn: "If there is any truth in the
Fatherhood, would not annihilation be even more a punishment of God
than of man? The annihilated creature would indeed be gone
forever&mdash;good and evil, shame and misery, penalty and pain, would for
him all be ended with his being; but it would not be so with God&mdash;out
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240"
id="page_240">{240}</a></span> his memory the name of the man could
never perish, and it would be, as it were, the eternal symbol of a
soul he had made only to find that with it he could do nothing better
than destroy it."<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_118" id="R_118"
href="#F_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) <i>In the Future Life.</i>&mdash;Doubtless our difficulties are not
at an end even so; but, at least, our conception of God is saved from
self-contradiction; and the Father is seen as suffering in the sin of
the son, and perpetually desiring and seeking his return, never
satisfied so long as any child of his still refuses his place in the
Father's love. This deep-going principle of reverence for personality,
with which we are dealing, is the finest flower of human ethical
development, and seems completely to shut out the possibility of
compulsion by God at any time in the future life. A person will never
be treated as a thing. The soul that turns to God must be won
voluntarily.</p>

<p>And if, then, the abstract possibility of endless resistance to God
by men cannot be denied; so neither can the possibility&mdash;perhaps one
might even say, the practical probability&mdash;be denied that God, in his
infinite love and patience and wisdom, may finally win them all <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span> out
of their resistance. And the eternal hope is at least open; but it is
open, it should be noted, only upon the fulfilment by men of precisely
those moral conditions which hold now in the earthly life, and which
ought now to be obeyed. There will never be an easier way to God. It
is shallow thinking that supposes that, if there be any possibility of
turning to God in the future life, it is of small moment that one
should now put himself where he ought to be. The full results of all
our evil sowing, we must receive. The utmost that on any rational
theory, then, can be held out to men, is the hope that, facing a
greater heritage of evil than now they face, they might return to God
under the same condition of absolute moral surrender, which now holds,
and the fulfilment of which is now far more easily possible to
them.</p>

<p>And it ought not to be overlooked that, even if the principle of
reverence for personality be much less far-reaching than is here
affirmed, the annihilation of a soul by God could seem justified only
upon the assumption that God foresaw the entire future, and knew that
the soul would never turn to righteousness and God. But if the
doctrine of annihilation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242"
id="page_242">{242}</a></span> is to be justified on <i>that</i>
ground, it is to be observed, that the same foreknowledge would have
enabled God to know before creation all the finally incorrigible, if
there were to be any such, and so he need not have called these into
being at all. A goal, therefore, as great if not far greater, than
that offered by the annihilation theory would be, thus, attainable
simply upon the same assumption that must rationally be made by that
theory, and, at the same time, the great objection to that theory&mdash;its
violation of personality&mdash;would be avoided.</p>

<p>It seems probable that this very principle of reverence for
personality contains the chief reason why more has not been revealed
to us concerning the future life. Christianity is very far from
satisfying our curiosity here. It gives little more than the
absolutely needed assurance of the fact and worth of the life beyond.
Details are either quite lacking, or given only in broadest symbols.
This reticent silence of revelation seems needed if our individual
initiative is not to be hindered, either by excess of motive on the
one hand, or by the depression of an unappreciated ideal on the other
hand.</p>

<p>On the one hand, that is, so far as we could <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span>
understand a detailed revelation of the future life, to set it forth
with the realism of the present life would be to interfere with that
unobtrusive relation of God to us, which we have seen to be so
necessary to our highest moral training. We need, in this time of our
training, a certain obscurity of spiritual truth; we need to walk by
faith, not by sight. To be able so obviously to weigh the eternal
realities against the temporal, would hinder rather than help our
growth in loyal, unselfish character.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a complete and indubitable revelation of the
future life were given us, no doubt there would be much that could
make but small appeal to us, and might even prove positively
depressing, because we have not yet the experience which would
interpret to us its meaning and open to us its joy. Our earthly life
may furnish us an analogy. The joy of a grown man is often
preëminently in his work, but he would find it difficult to explain to
a child the source of his joy. And if the child were told that there
would come a time in a few years when his chief joy would be found in
work, the prospect would probably not seem to him inviting. The wisest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244"
id="page_244">{244}</a></span> of us may be as little prepared to
enter in detail into the meaning of the future life.</p>

<p>We may be content to know that the future life is, and is of value
beyond that which we can now understand; and we may be assured that at
least what we have already seen to be the ideal conditions of the
richest life,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_119" id="R_119"
href="#F_119">[119]</a></span> as now we understand life, will be
fully met in the future life. We can hardly doubt, therefore, that the
two great centers of the life beyond must be association and work;
though we may not know the precise forms that these will take, nor how
greatly both may deepen beyond our present conception. Steadily
deepening personal relations, rooted in the one absolutely satisfying
relation to God in Christ, there must be; and work, in which one may
lose himself with joy, because it is God's work. This, at least, the
future life will contain. We can hardly go farther with assurance.</p>

<p>But perhaps even this may suggest, that men may vary much in the
proportionate emphasis laid upon these two great sources of life, and
still alike come into a genuine and rewarding relation to God. That
God has counted individuality among men to be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span> of prime significance,
the facts of creation hardly allow us to doubt. Possibly it is only
another application of this same principle of reverence for the
person, in the recognition of that individuality which has its great
joy in work, which is to be found in what Professor George F. Genung
suggestively calls "an apocalypse of Kipling." In Kipling's poem to
Wolcott Balestier, Professor Genung sees "the discovery of a religion,
or assignable and eternally rewardable relation to God, in those whose
inner life is not introspective or self-expressive." Their spiritual
life "serves God with the joy which comes of following and satisfying,
in the sphere of his plans, the eager bent of a conquering will." "It
is the religion of work and of daring." And "it is only in the open
vision of an eternal world that their secular ardor, which was
unconsciously serving God all along, begins to come to the perception
of a transcendent master and to be transformed into an adoration, an
obedience and loyalty, a 'will to serve or to be still as fitteth our
Father's praise.'"</p>

<p>It is quite possible that through our very failure to enter into
God's own deep reverence for the person, in the recognition of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span>
man's divinely given individuality, as well as through failure to
recognize the essential like-mindedness of men, we have been shutting
the door of hope, where God has not shut it, and have limited beyond
warrant the divine mercy. Even in the life of heaven men cannot be all
alike. "Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own
lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the
Lord hath power to make him stand."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_120" id="R_120" href="#F_120">[120]</a></span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
